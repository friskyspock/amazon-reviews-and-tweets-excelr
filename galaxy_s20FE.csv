Was so confused n had to force reboot .. I could hear all d notification sounds n incoming call alerts but my screen was completely dead... After force rebooting few times d display was on but went dead again in a matter of 2 mins... Have given for service n d authorised agent s saying of a hardware issue, n d part has to be replaced .. wat s d quality of a device tat u spent 40-50k if it fails with complaints within weeks of purchase... D only positive s tat d product service s covered under warranty as it was not caused bcoz of me .. it's too painful to wait for a week to get d device back after service n I m not even hopeful tat it won't occur back in future.. looks like I made a poor choice choosing a worthless device spending so much money just for d brand name samsung... There r much better options for better price than this... DONT EVER GO FOR THIS DEVICE...

Ravi K Tallam,Substandard product from samsung,"I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.Update3:Jio True 5G is not working yet only Airtel 5G works on this mobile.  Some update has to come from Samsung/Jio to make it work . So, this is not a true 5G  phone yet. Other Samsung models(s20 series, s21 series) are supporting Jio 5G.

abseng,Horrible battery life,"My review after using this for 10 days:Pros:Software/smoothness of UICameraBuild qualitySound quality, both via speakers and earphones.Cons:Battery - Very bad battery backup.  I am using phone at 60 Hz, keeping brightness low/manual mode, keeping phone in power saving mode, turning 5g off (I am aware 5g is still not available) and doing everything possible to squeeze out enough battery life. I am not a gamer and use the device for mostly YouTube/video streaming, messaging and emails. I rarely use the camera.  With all this I can barely get through one day.  What will happen when 5g becomes available?...and what is the point of having 120 Hz display if it drains the battery so quickly. I had complained to Amazon regarding battery and they did send a ""technician"" to check; all he did was run some mobile-checking software on my device, said everything was fine and left...typical.Charging: 15 Watt charger in box to add to the horrible battery life.Network/call reception: Below par. Have noticed many call drops, especially while taking calls via speaker, for some reason.Other aspects:Display: Good. Nothing extraordinary compared to competitors.Flagship features: Wireless charging, IP68/water/dust-resistant, Dex mode, etc. - Not useful for me personally (never ever have got my phone wet for any reason, but good to have water resistance).Fingerprint reader: Bad, misses more than 50% times.Verdict:Highly disappointed personally, because for me battery is the highest priority. I was using a much cheaper device previously and with my usage, older device was giving me 1.5 days battery life easily, and fast charging also was available. Not satisfied with cellular reception too.Overall, go for this device if camera is your highest priority at this price (I got it for 34k during Amazon sale).",3.0 out of 5 stars
NIMISH,Best phone under 40k,"2 words, Mind blowing!This is the most balanced phone in the segment, perfect for my usage pattern. Didn't want to go for OnePlus after the UI merger with Oppo, and I already have a Oneplus Nord 2 at home (one of the best under 30k) and I took the decision of not going with Oxygen OS.This has been the best decision ever. I instantly fell in love with One UI. Plus the package that this S20 FE 5g offers at around 37k is amazing.Not for you if you take a lot of raw selfies or expect extreme raw performance. But I don't want both and hence it's the best for me. It does well in all the aspects except front camera.Battery life is amazing, phone looks and feels great, comfortable sizing and weight balance, a mind blowing 120Hz Super Amoled display, and a great UI with Software support.The most complete phone you can get today at the price, no compromises at all. Officially a ""Samsung Fanboy"" now!",5.0 out of 5 stars

tommie,Samsung S20FE 5G Phone crashed after 3 months after warranty,"My phone worked okay for 1 year and immediately after 1 year, the battery performance started degrading pretty fast. Exactly 3 months after the warranty period is over, it refused to start after it got drained out completely, which seemed like it was programmed to fail.When I took it to the service center, they said motherboard is gone and it will costs at least 20K to replace it and the warranty for changed motherboard would be only 6 months. Then they said battery is also bulged which will cost another 3+K  to replace.Now my question is1) how is a 35K valued phone which was sold 1.3 years back has all the spare parts put together costing double than that of a new phone.2) Is Samsung doing the right things to support their flagship brands?3) Is Made in India product have poor endurance when compared to other chinese product?",1.0 out of 5 stars

At first choice was not very sure, but in hand it felt ultimate satisfaction with the purchase. Not that camera savvy, since the phone which known to be for much, but there are lot many other features too which stand at par to service the best.The couple of features that i liked most -- Ultimate one that I could operate my entire mobile phone from the laptop over Bluetooth connection, right from call to other app that exist on mobile.- Single take feature in camera and it's intelligence to capture moments is awesome.- Touch panel too smooth to operate, have a try you will feel it.- Too good light sensors for you screen to auto adjust brightness to your comfort.- Sound very happy, and dolby atmos feature for custom sound adjustment is a plus.- Bang on powerful charging, bit heats during charge but cools on complete charging. No heating issue observed so far.- Bixby for voice command, ultimate works.Cons:- 3.5 mm jack was nothing like it if made available, but nevertheless Bluetooth feature overcomes.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Madhur Tiwari,Most amazing phone under 40k,"Camera is amazing, OIS works fine, it's  a good decision to go with this phone instead of oneplus, nothings phone 1 or xiaomi. Also i Don't  trust these chinese phones..Pros: cameraOne UI 4 is so clean and easy to useI like the feature like samsung pay and samsung  dex mostNice built quality not a cheap oneCons:I think It doesn't have..oh you say that battery backup is less and software updates.. for me not a big issue.... battery backup 10-11 hrs quite good for me.. 15w fast charging is also good for me because  battery charging is chemical reaction  it good to slow charge the battery... I'm not saying these things for satisfying  myself.For software update.. samsung provide updates till 2024 i think.. also not big issue for me.. I'm not going to use more than 2 years... so not a big problem  for me.. it's  a good deal go for it and ask your self for these question  weather these small things matter to you or not... 10/10 samsung s20 fe 5g üòÅüñ§üëç",5.0 out of 5 stars
me,Good phone . Bad battery and less optimised software.,"Camera is good , software is decent , many features .Not for gaming as samsung screwed up with game optimization and so it's really underwhelming, no custom roms .Worst part is battery backup is really bad . Have to charge twice atleast on normal use .Highly recommend midrange phones. Moto phones these days are getting good. And if you can install roms , get a redmi note 10 pro and install custom rom. Or even get a note 11 pro and get a custom rom.Wait for pixel 6a or get a midrange phone and a good camera .",3.0 out of 5 stars
Anisia,Don't buy the cell from Amazon ! Screen not working on the 8th day.,Hi Everyone.. the reason I'm writing here to to let you know the difficulty I'm facing after purchasing this cell. The screen is not working and now because it's the 8th day Amazon is not accepting replacement and Samsung has also denied the replacement cause I bought the cell from Amazon. So even if the cell is a bit more expensive please buy the cell from the store and not Amazon.The customer service of Amazon is also very bad. They have asked me to stay without a cell for 7 days and will update me after that. Useless customer support with lack of knowledge.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Chromaniac,Wi-Fi becomes horribly slow when the phone is warm due to charging or heavy usage,"The phone itself is great. Camera is pretty nice. Especially for me as I am trying to upgrade from S10 Lite. Primarily wanted to buy this for wireless charging and water resistance. However, one massive issue in the unit that I got today‚Ä¶ Wi-Fi is extremely glitchy. My S10 Lite remains stable on 866mbps in network details. S20 FE fluctuates anywhere form ~300-500mbps. If this was not bad enough, the phone‚Äôs Wi-Fi speed drops hugely when it gets slightly warm. My 300mbps connection barely registers 15-20mbps on this phone. Should mention here that there are lots of isolated cases of S20 series phones having similar issues online. From Samsung‚Äôs own support forum to XDA to reddit and other Android communities.If you buy this phone, my recommendation would be to keep an eye on the wi-fi performance. WiFiMan is a great app would show the connection speed with router (internet speed is irrelevant here if you are not on a gigabit connection). On my device it fluctuates heavily with upload speed falling down to 6mbps regularly and staying there for long periods. This could very well be Samsung throttling Wi-Fi modem to save battery I imagine. But this could end up hurting longer downloads or creating slowdowns while doing simple tasks.I ended up applying for a refund. I love this phone but I cannot rely on Samsung on fixing the unreliable wifi in a future software update. They need to acknowledge the problem in Sep 21 batch.",1.0 out of 5 stars

DD Kushwaha,Worst Phone ever.. Samsung is willingly dumping FAULTY PHONE via AMAZON SALE,"Story and the problem:- The screen of phone got Black within 21 days of purchase. The same issue is reported by several customers who bought this S20FE mobile (especially Aug-Sept Make); Service centre (Noida) informd me that they have received more than 50 phone within last 15 days with similar issue [All Screen Blackout issue].Conclusion: SAMSUNG India Company has been using Sub-Standard components during manufacturing process under the brand name of ""MAKE IN INDIA"". All defective items are being dumped across the nation through AMAZON/FLIPKART Sale. This is a new example of Fraud and cheating...Solution of the issue: Service centre guys are very much aware abt the issue. They will happily repair your brand new phone. I got my repaired phone within 2 days. They said ""Sorry Sir, what can we do if company has sold the defective lot of phones"".Result:- WOORRRSSSTTTTTT Experience with Samsung.Remedy:- SAMSUNG should collect all the defective phones manufactured under those lots and provide new phone to their valuable customers, if they really believe in ethics and morality.

I visited authorised service centre at Bangalore (Indira Nagar) with phone, They took some 1 hour for phone inspection and said, display damaged and need to change it. They quoted Rs. 8.5K for that. I argued that this problem started after SW upgrade and looks like a SW issue and still display is working and showing the initial screen with Samsung logo, but they did not agree. I asked them to return the device without repair. I visited the shop after couple of hours and collected the phone back.

Arun Sharma,Most non dependable mobile phone in market and non honouring of warranty by Samsung,"Purchased the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G in September'22. The phone was delivered in the 2nd week of October'22. I refrained from using it in initial days as I wanted to have the Tempered glass and a good cover prior to usage to increase the life and prevent any damage. On account of unavoidable circumstances, could install and use the phone in Nov'22 only. Phone suffered from weird black screen issue since early days. The Screen would black out and restore by itself. During the blackout the phone would vibrate and ring. It was taken twice to the service centre and they had no clue as the phone was anyways functioning during the visit. They advised to visit when the event happened. A few days back the frequency increased to 4-5 times a day and I took it to the authorised service centre. Handed over the phone to them with touch in working condition  but screen blackened out after a few minutes. Upon examination, they recommend that touch screen to be replaced but are now mentioning a very minor dent as the reason why screen cannot be replaced in warranty. The dent is very difficult to detect by a normal eye and there is not even a single scratch on the screen. Refer current photos attached. Samsung simply refuses to acknowledge that it was a faulty piece since start, even though the issue is highlighted and discussed by number of customers on Forum on their official website. They are only verbal sympathizers, with aim only to increase customer's loss. In case any one purchases this so called premium phone by Samsung, it is suitable only to be kept in showcase after purchase and not meant to be used, so that warranties are not lapsed.",1.0 out of 5 stars

And Amazon didn‚Äôt have any other service option available as well for generating service request to check the issue in the mobile.

Vinod S.,A flagship experience at an affordable price,"Hello Everyone,Before purchasing I also had done a lot of research by viewing tech channels review about this phone on YouTube & also seeing reviews on Flipkart + Amazon, finally, I purchased the phone & have shared my honest review with you to clear your confusion & I will try to make my review as clear as possible üòä**DISPLAY***Beautiful AMOLED screen, lesser bezels, most reviewers say the display is not brighter under sunlight but believe me nothing like this, I had never faced any issue while using it outside, it is bright enough to use under sunlight.**SPEAKER***Dual speakers which are loud enough & with a good amount of base.**PROCESSOR***Fast, you will not feel lagging anywhere.**SIZE***Does not feel bulky.**BACK***The back is plastic which is fine since mostly we use it with back covers, I personally prefer a plastic back design since glass back can damage easily if proper care is not taken & then their repair cost is very high.**CAMERA***The camera quality is good even in low light, no other mobile camera under 30k can come near to this in terms of picture & video quality, also you get OIS which gives great stable videos & also you get a telephoto lens in which up to 10X you get good usable pictures whereas it can zoom up to 30x.**Battery***I do not recommend this phone for those who use the phone heavily or are heavy gamers as then you might have to charge your phone 2 times a day. If you are a casual user then there will be no issue, on normal usage phone will have still 20-25% easily by end of the day.**CHARGING***Now charging speed is the only thing which I did not like about this phone, the phone comes with a 15-watt charger which charges the phone from 0 to 100% in approx. 1 hr. 50 minutes, it supports a 25-watt charger as well, which charges from 0 to 100% in approx. 1 hr. 30 minutes. Overall, not a huge difference since only a 10-watt difference between both chargers, so approx. 20-25 minutes difference you will see in charging speed.**NOW SOME TIPS FOR HAVING SOME EXTRA BATTERY LIFE***If you want to see a good improvement in the battery life then use your phone with ‚ÄúPower Saving‚Äù mode always turned on.  I personally do this.**FOR FASTER FINGERPRINT SCANNING***1. Go to Settings>Biometrics and security>Fingerprints>Turn off Show animation while unlocking option.2. Go to Settings>Biometrics and security>More biometric settings>Turn off Show unlock transition effect option.So, if you are looking for a phone which gives a flagship phone kind of experience under 35K then you can go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Gagandeep Singh,FE means Fool's Edition,"Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.",1.0 out of 5 stars

On battery improvement articles say reduce frequency of amoled display and what not, but what is the use if you can't have display enhanced with useless battery.

Security of data.6. Nice feel of the phone.Cons :1. In display fingerprint is a little slow than other external fingerprint readers.2. Battery life is average. Normal usage would last a day but for heavy usage you need to charge it again the same day.3. No fast charger in the box and supports upto 25W charging only.If you want a great phone for everyday usage this is the best deal at the best price.

Subhayu De Sarkar,Probably the best phone in this segment,"Using this phone for more than a couple of weeks now. I was using Samsung Note series earlier, so naturally my expectations were very high and I must say that this phone has not disappointed me at all. I had gone through detailed reviews before purchase and the phone delivered what expected. After using it for sometime, below are my observations:1) The glastic build looks premium and good to hold in hand. But could be better with metal body / glass back.2) Weight of the phone is a bit on the higher side compare to the last note series phone I was using. It may be due to the bigger battery and bigger screen size. But really does not make much differences.3) In terms of capacity, the battery might not be the best one. But it is quite optimized with the processor and gives almost similar backup with higher battery capacity phones with lower processors. For me the battery lasts for around 1.5 days with moderate usage. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging feature makes it different from others in the segment.4) Does not have FM radio and even I did not have it in my last note series phone as well. Probably the flagships do not have it. No difference for me, but of course it is a nice to have feature.5) No 3.5 mm jack. May be a concern but I think it is aligned with the vision of wireless accessories for flagships. If you need it, one can buy USB C-Type to 3.5 mm converter.6) For the flagship processor, performance is really smooth and fast. No heating at all.7) Supports 25 Watt fast charging but box contains 15 watt charger. This is a bit disappointing. With 15 Watt charger it takes around a couple of hours to get fully charged from ZERO.8) IP68 protection is really a flagship feature and it is the only phone in this segment to offer it.9) Hybrid 2nd SIM slot with up to 1TB memory card support is useful. But I would prefer a dedicated memory card slot.10) 5G support is not relevant for India as of now but can not do much with it since it is a standard offering nowadays with flagship processors in all the phones in this segment.11) India as Country of Origin probably get an extra thumbs up.12) Nothing to mention about camera. It is indeed one of the best without any gimmick of megapixels or extra lenses. It just optimum with best output. 8MP Telephoto lens makes it different.13) With additional 6K instant discount makes it absolutely value for money and even better than all competitor phones around it.What else you need? It is absolutely Value for Money and probably the best smartphone in this segment as of now.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Its my own experience, that the Camera performance of this phone is 10 times better than the One Plus 10 pro 5G which has Hasselblad camera. I didn't faced any processing issue till now. I tried playing every game with the maximum graphics settings that game allows, and the game ran smoothly. While playing for a longer period of time the back of the phone gets heat up, which is normal and quite understandable. The battery performance is average. With 100% charge, you can use the phone for the entire day and still you will be left with 23-25% of battery. The sAmoled Display is also awesome. Its the best display in my experience till now. There were zero bloatware, clean UI and time to time Android and Android security patch updates I receive till now which is Good. Overall the phone is Good.

Water resistance - IP68 given was great from Samsung. Even i tested it.5. Price- I bought it for 33k. But really worth for this Flagship mobile at this price range.6. Stereo speakers gave a good output of clear audio.Cons:Battery: Battery ofcourse when you always use it with 120hz lasts for 6 hrs. Better change to 60hz to gain more hours.Charger: Samsung gave only 15w charging adapter in the box. While it supports upto 25w superfast charging. Please use 25w PD samsung adapter.In my mind i had only two options S20 fe 5g and S21fe 5g. S21 have Exynos 2100 processor  with 10k more than S20 fe.

Priya,Samsung ships with known issue - Display dead in less than one month,"I have been an user of Samsung mobile phones more than a decade, but the quality of Samsung S20 FE 5G is pathetic. The phone display is dead within one monthI took the phone to Samsung service center and they said display is faulty and it will be replaced. They ordered the display and informed takes 3 days to receive. Since no major questions were asked by the service center, I checked if this was a known issue. To my surprise they said ""Yes"", this particular model the installed display doesn't work once the software is updated, and this precisely what has happened in my case. The phone was working the previous day night and probably the software was updated during night which spoiled the displayI am surprised that ""Samsung"" ships phone with known problem, what a waste of time for customer to run around for service and be deprived of the phone till the issue is resolved",1.0 out of 5 stars

Experience using this phone has been great, liked the smoothness of the display and camera app. has lot of options which help in enhancing the limitations of the camera compared to pixel phones.Battery could have been better and charger should have been 25W instead 15W.Over-all,  very happy to have this phone!!!

Archisman D.,Absolute flagship with some flaws,"PROS: The phone is overall amazing, what you expect from a S series phone. The plastic body doesn't bother me at all because the quality of the plastic is great and matt to touch (feels better than some glass back phones). Awesome back cameras, good selfie camera. Very good display and 120hz refresh rate. Is a breast in performance.CONS: The only two cons which I find important to tell are:-1) Battery life- The phone has good battery life but not great. At 120 hz it will get you through the day of decent to heavy use. But at the end of the day, at late evening, you will find the need to change the phone.2) Finger print reader- The in-display finger print reader is surprisingly slow and often doesn't even detect the finger if the finger is wet, dusty or no matter what. I highly recommend you to keep atleast 2-3 finger prints of different fingers saved at all times, or keep a really short password because you'll need to type it a lot more than you think.",5.0 out of 5 stars

On the very first step of sell you are delivering a damage product to the customer just by luring with your best offers but in the post sale services your fooling the customers by not providing the exact solutions needed.In my case, AMAZON delivered a damaged phone upon my order placed. The phone had many issues, when a replacement was asked with my request post following their all the escalation matrix a lot couple of times they delivered a dead phone. It is not even powering ON, nothing is working and now they need more time and keeping up following the escalation matrix rather than providing a valid solution.I had order Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G during the ‚ÄúGreat Indian Festival‚Äù Diwali sale, I received the product on 25th and the phone was having a heating issue as well the battery was draining very quickly.

Placeholder,Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!,"Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here.

Neeraja,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON. WORST SAMSUNG SERVICE,"After 11 days from delivery, I faced a screen blackout problem. I called Samsung customer care center and they told me if it is a hardware problem then Samsung has a policy of replacement within 14 days from purchase. Here is what this Amazon starts cheating. Amazon has 7 days policy of return. So I went to Samsung's authorized service center. They registered a complaint but replaced the display and battery in brand new phone. After that my voice is not audible during voice calls. Service center has confirmed it. I checked at various locations if it is a network issue with different network companies. But it was not a network issue. It is issue appeared after it is repaired.If there is a defect in an electronic product, a manufacturing company is responsible for this. If manufacturing company has policy of replacement within 14 days then, from where a customer is buying a product like a phone that doesn't matter.In Service center, they advised to buy phone from local market, do not buy from Amazon.So I recommend;1. Do not buy from Amazon or any online platform.2. All these big companies like Samsung, Amazon have fake (convenient for them) policies.3. They do not care at all if a customer is facing any trouble because of them.4. I recommend that DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG PHONE.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Deepak Singh,Does what it's meant to be,"It's been 2 weeks of usage. I don't use my phone for anything heavy most of the time except multitasking and occasional gaming. So I haven't yet reaped the most of it.Inclusion of a type c to 3.5mm dac cable could have been nice but meh, nowadays very few people are into wireless because of the convenience.Photos come amazing at day. It is almost effortless. At night however things get interesting. You have to play with settings. I am in suburbs right now. So light sources make huge difference in the outcome. 3x telephoto lens is a banger. I cant get enough of it.Performance is out of the question as SD865 works tirelessly to give u a butter smooth experience. 8GB RAM just makes your life bit easier as u might find apps put to halt in the bg.Battery life is great according to me. In a world full of chargers more than 25w, the charging seems slow. But 25w isnt bad. An hour of staying away from the screen and u are good to go. Yeah if u are thinking of gaming, dont expect much.

Decided to go with samsung after seeing lot of decent reviews online.Pros:1.Camera is quite good compared to one plus 9r .My wife owns it so can vouch for it.Cons:1. Battery drain very fast. With 120hz,it will last only 7 to 8 hours with average use. Had to change it to 60 hz and now it runs for full day.2. Missed warp charger from my one plus 6. Very slow charging,takes more than an hour to charge.3.Inspite of having snapdragon 765, it is not fast. ONLY Prior one plus user can sense it.My wife one plus 9r is certainly faster.4. Voice quality is average. One plus 9r has better microphone.5. Wifi connectivity is not great on this phone. I could not live stream india pakistan match on hotstar where as my wife one plus 9r was running live stream smoothly. Both device were connected to same account and same wifi network. Was not expecting this from samsung flagship phone.ALL IN ALL IF U ARE LOOKING FOR FANTABOULUS CAMERA,GO FOR IT.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Amey,Battery backup is kinda okaish,Everything is good upto markJust the battery it feels like little lessNot playing games not doing heavy activity on the phone only using for social media and some office work(app like teams LinkedIn PDFs etc) still it has to be charged for 2 times in a day.It provides 8-10 hour backup for using slightly all this apps. It should have provide more backup minimum of 14-16 hours.I don't think so if a started playing games like pubg on this phone it will last long for more than 6 hours or so,5.0 out of 5 stars

Takes more than 2 Hrs full charge.2) Phone feels nothing less than heater while turning on hotspots or using Doodle camera.3) What a let down processor is well4) Always issue with Real camera portrait . Hardly it works.5) Phone brightness . Biggest irritating part. Has no control.6) Instagram and Facebook app has issue.Have been using  just 12K Realme 5 pro for last 2.5 years.And this being  flagship  has the charging  capacity  of last decade .Had never tried Samsung before and never going to use it hereafter.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Charan,"Serious Wifi throttling and slight heating issue, rest is great","Used the phone for a while and tried to install Call of duty. It was painfully slow, even on my 200 Mbps , 5Ghz wifi channel.  Immediately checked speeds on old op5t, it was blazing fast while it was throttling to max 16Mbps on this phone.I let the phone cool for a while and download speed was back over 100 Mbps. Then opened the COD app, and again same issue for in-game downloads.Conclusion: Thermals throttling wifi speeds.Tried resetting network settings and even the phone itself. Still, it would work for few mins and start throttling.Had to return it even though I liked everything else, especially the display and camera features.Looked it up online and found an xda dev thread and looks like sept 2021 manufactured devices have this problem. And no software updates have fixed this problem.Would buy this again in a heartbeat, if the issue is fixed. ü§ûüèºUpdate 18/06:  Bought it again and seeing same problem again.

Even with the 25w charger there is hardly a 5 minute difference, the overall charging is very slow, other phones like one plus offer qucok charging which is really quick and useful if u need a quick charge in 10 mins (this phone can't even do 10% in that time) you can check youtube for charging videos of S20fe 5g.Camera quality is not that great frankly. Even a little zoom will give u a very bad pixelated effect.Fingerprint t sensor is slow and doesn't work half the time frankly. Face unlock is also very poor. Oneplus standards for both were much higher.

This could happen every couple of day or multiple times in a day. Reached out to service teams but they are not able to fix or provide replacement. This is a serious issue as you could miss important calls or it could stop working during an important task like map shutting down while driving, call drops, Hotspot shutting down.

Sherbir,Great phone in the upper mid range segment,I've been a die hard Samsung fan since 2013. I mostly exchange older Samsungs for newer ones. This one was no exception and was a definitely the best mid range phone I could buy in exchange for my roughly 3 year old extremely good Samsung Galaxy A50. I usually buy only mid segment phones and this was a good choice considering1. Battery life (very important due to my heavy usage for official calls instant messages and what have you). I get about a day and a half.2. Effortless photography: the 12MP rear camera is excellent and the portrait mode clicks some excellent shots and effortlessly processes into very professional looking photos with some excellent depth of field control. The pro mode offers even more control and enhancement with shutter speed and ISO controls built in. Honestly the 12MP beats any of the high end 32MP or 60MP camera samples.Also the video recording is in 4k with optical image stability so that was a definite welcome change from the older shaky camera videos to much smoother motion videos.4. Beautiful bright and vivid screen colors and wallpapers. 120 Hz refresh rate is possible for superfast and fluid motion. Though this does cause quite a fast battery drain but nothing to really bother except you get about 12 hours  before a charge. Good enough for my usage.5. A very fast fingerprint and face unlock mechanism that works everytime without fail.6. Plastic back but very elegant and doesn't smudge fingerprints. More on the executive or professional side with the midnight blue color.7. Snapdragon chipset with multi band 5G support instead of the Exynos on the older Samsung Galaxy S20FE  version (one of the reasons that finalized my deal)The only downsides I have for this phone:1. No headphone jack. I had to separately buy a Bluetooth headset and a secondary USB to 3.5mm adapter jack2. Slightly high price compared to what I have usually paid for mid range Samsung phones but this time most companies have brought in an upper mid range section for the premium devices in the mid range segment so thats kinda marketing strategy of all companies in 2021.Overall I am quite happy and satisfied with the phone's performance and daily usage.,5.0 out of 5 stars

But the twist in the tale is that it charges the phone pretty fast and i got to know when i used it and charging in such pace is not a deal breaker at all guys.Its a top notch performer and in 32k no phone can have the most important x factor i.e IP68.i  am able to use the wired earphone of google pixel in this phone and working pretty well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Achinta Mandal,VFM king even in 2022,"This is a gem of a phone. The specs don't do justice to it. The display is smooth af and the colours are eye popping good lol.OneUI is extremely smooth when it comes to app animations and camera app. It is great for light to moderate users however I would not recommend it to those whose sole purpose is gaming as it heats up a lot when you push it to its max performance.Battery is average but it is ok for a flagship phone with avg of 4.5 hours of screen on time, it also has decent standby time of around 20 hours so it will easily last you a day with normal office uses. I have used the phone on 120hz refresh rate since it gives a great experience, however you can switch it to 60hz for better battery life.And there is little to speak about camera since it inherits the same flagship sensors of high end Samsung phones. It has the best camera at this price point in my opinion.This is an overall great phone and provides good value for money. Go for it!üëç",5.0 out of 5 stars

Saikat ganguly,Good phone worth purchasing,"Hello,I have been using this phone for 1.5 yearsPros#1.handy and sturdy,easy to hold this phone in your grip.2.Camera segment is the best,realistic picture,video quality is also good,best is video quality.3.softare and security patch update is random and samsung gives it frequently.one ui is also smooth4.865 snapdragon is good but not the best,bt overall it will help you to complete your daily life multitasking smoothly.for medium usage it is one of the best.5.Dual dolby speakers give you a decent sound quality.6.if you don't put excessive apps then it works fine,some may face overheating,but personally I don't feel much.Cons#1.Battery life is not good,if you have to get 14_15 hrs backup then you have to turn on the battery saving mode,reduce your screen refresh rate to 60hz then you may get it,Usually it takes 2 times charging in a day for medium usage.Samsung should work to fix this issue for their upcoming phone.2.finger print sensor is quite slow,but overall it will affect your usage.Not ultra first but expect for more agility.some China phones do it better than that.3.15 watt charger is given by company but this another problem I must address,it takes almost 1.5 hrs to complete charging.No superfast charging option is available although I think these superfast charging makes your battery less potent so may be they don't give it.4.Not for heavy gaiming.if you are heavy gamer then this phone is not for you,865 snapdragon can't give you smooth experience,frame rates could be dropped,so if you are opting for gaming phone don't buy it.5. Another thing what I felt personally that s series phones could get better display,although it has ambled fhd display but Samsung's expertise was for their display but in this phone you get A series screen which is a backdrop I guess.Conclusion#If you are a mediocre in phn usage then you definitely buy it.for 1.5 years I don't need to go to the service center for once.only bcz I use it mostly on YouTube whatsapp 1_2 gb gaming and the burden which I put is quite less.if you want it for daily usage like surfing,medium gaming,then it is the best.The more you put pressure the more you get lagging issue and it is evident for every single phone.my recommendations will help you I guess Thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Google for this problem and you will see several posts about this, with no resolution. Replacement or refund is extremely difficult due to reasons listed elsewhere. The initial setup took hours because of the slow wifi performance. Extremely frustrating!Amazon sent a Sept 2021 built phone on 20th May 2022 - a full 10 months old phone. Not acceptable at all.

Varun Bhat,Without a doubt 100% value for money. I got this during festival sale for 36k.,Hi all I'm writing this review after 1 month of intense usage intense usage means more than 5 hours a day. I'll divide this review into 2 sections prosand cons.Pros :-1. Cameras are very good. Easily give tough  competition to iPhone 12 and 13  lineups.2. Performance is also very good.3. Feels premium in hand. You don't feel  plastic back. Feels like a matte glass.4. Display is very nice. Super amoled with  120hz refresh rate is a deadly  combination.5. Software experience. Yes One UI is the  best Android skin available on the  market. Very smooth and well  optimised. Noticed one or two bugs but  that's fine.6. Audio output is very good.Cons :-1. Fingerprint is average not upto the mark.  Very slow and not responsive.2. Battery life and Charger. Battery will lost  about 5-6 hours not a full day. And it  takes 1.5 hours to charge 0-100% and  23W fast charge won't work with other  company charging bricks.3. It heats up a lot.4. Due to that huge camera housing lens  flarings are high.Final verdict :-If your budget is around 40k or under 50k just close your eyes and go for this. Excellent phone and value for money.Suggestion :- Go for mint green color it's very awesome.,5.0 out of 5 stars

NP,No Gimmicks + DEX + Excellent Camera,"In this era of 2MP macro-mono-depth stupidity in midrangers and budget-flagships, this device stands out with its pure functional and flagship-like camera setup. DEX is another amazing functionality, i wonder why people are not mentioning it in reviews. Samsung has promised 4 years of security updates and 3 android major updates. There are 9 5G bands, so i assume this phone is truly 5G-ready in India. These points were enough for me to shift to this phone. I read some reviews complaining heating issues and ordinary design of this phone. Though I am not a heavy gamer, I use my phone for a long consecutive times. It only got warm during initial setup. But there was NO heating issue otherwise. About design, it is a personal choice. I am not a fan of glass backs (am i the only one on this planet?) Phone still looks very premium in my opinion.I switched from OP5 after almost 4 years. OP5 was one-of-its-kind, and was ahead of its time. Sadly oneplus is no more the enthusiast brand that it was some years ago. Single band 5g, shady updates (i heard op7, op7t got slower with the updates), and i just hate that 2/5 MP mono camera  that op is standardizing these days. Concluding, Samsun S20 FE 5G is a perfect choice for someone who is looking for non flashy, simple design yet truly functional and non-gimmicky experience in a device that can be used for around 3-3.5 years.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Ashish,Comparable to Iphone 12 and better than oneplus 9.,"I'm already using iPhone 12 and wanted to buy another phone. Initially, I was thinking of iPhone but I accidentally got to know about this product. After some reviews, I figured out it is a quite good product for the price point. It's pretty close to the iPhone in terms of performance and camera quality.The great thing about this phone is Snapdragon SOC is used over notorious exynos SOC. So there is no heating issue with it.After usages of a couple of weeks, I can safely say this is a good alternate for iPhone at a much affordable price point. I have also tested Oneplus 9 but the Samsung camera is way better than it.Overall it's a solid value for money product. Anyday better than one plus and for this price better than iPhone.There is one more point worth noting:Spare parts and repairing Samsung is much cheaper. So, if you have a flimsy hand just stay away from the iPhone as screen replacement itself costs more than 20-25K where as in Samsung it costs 10-12K.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Eshan Mehra,Below average phone,"I have been using this phone for little over a year, I had bought it for 30k with exchange. The battery life is good but it depends on your usage, i need to charge it 2-3 times a day. It's sturdy it has fallen alot of times but still going good.

Omkarn,This phone is simply awesome.,After using for a month I am writing this review. I purchased it for 40500 on emi. This is really good smartphone. I am pretty impressed with the camera. Display quality is also nice.In display Fingerprint is somewhat slow. I didn't find any connectivity issue. Charging is bit slow as it's 15w charger. It's really good optimized but needs improvement though. Overnight there is mere charge loss. Some difficulties I faced while using this phone are as below.1) In built app locker is missing. There is option in developer settings but I don't recommend doing that.2)Dual app is available for messaging apps only. You can use secure folder for duplicating some apps but some of the apps which requires much more permissions can not be run from that folder.,5.0 out of 5 stars

nuthan,Not worth money. Not a paisa vasool product,"I was hyped to get this after reading all reviews, but was not upto expectation. Phone has best android support. Battery drains a lot faster compared to same other 4500mah phones. Camera quality ok, good thing is a lot of features are given in this phone that you won't get in  this price range. But what i feel is what's the use of these features if the output quality is bad. It's just like you have all the features but are of no use.Display is best, no doubt in that. If you are not used to slow charging, this might be pain for you. This phone is for who can't afford premium phones but want one. I suggest if you're budget is around 25k then go for this. If you can spend around 40k or 50k then go for iphone, coz samsungs do not have good resale value.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sushidh A.,"Overpriced for all the minor flaws, else its good","Review on 6 day usage:Pros:1. Happy to get a 4k offer discount during freedom sale time.2. This comes with a lot of good features specially on vidoe call background functionality.3. Camera quality is just fine for this price.4. System is working really fine. Keeps almost everythi g up to date automatically.Cons:1. Super annoying fingerprint reader. Very very slow compared to side or back reader function that is found in many phones. LG G7+ Thinq (my current phone) has the fastest reader like a snap. While samsung must have given same or atleast reader on the edge of phone. Pathetic and it is 1/10 for me.2. Charging: it takes more time to charge than the time remaining shown on screen while charging. Again, its a 3/10.3. You cant record calls while on WiFi Calling. Comeon samsung, small players are providing this function even in their budgeted phones. 1/10.4. It's almost a bulky phone. Samsung could have done better with size. Mmm 7/10.5. Brightness Control: its not sensitive or highly adaptive to encironment. Takes time to react to the lighting. 4/10.6. Shocking: no headphone jack. Means you need a c-type connector...means you must buy one...which means making the phone look like an assembled product. Samsung must privide the connector too. 0/10.Additional update:1. Pathetic screen brightness in strong daylight. Very tough to focus on object while using camera. Very poor screen and brightness.2. Battery: oh my god...so bad...shows time remain8ng but charges more than the said timeline.3. Processor: absolute disappointment. Gets very slow at times like flicker making it to lose interest in using the phone.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Prabu G,Good smartphone for normal to moderate use.,"Samsung s 20 fe 5g is definitely a good smartphone if not the best in this price segment. Switching from OP 7 to this turns out to be good choice. Just mentioning my opinion about this beautyPros:1. Awesome design and nice display2. Clean UI3. Decent battery life 7hrs + screen time(mixed usages)4. Specs and display good for gaming heat management not that great5. Camera is definitely the best part of phone ,it click sharp and clear picture with rear 12+12+8 megapixel camera setup.Got few cons too1.biometrics unlocking is little slow compared to OP.2 sometimes phone does get heated up.Charging is very slow compared to the competition,takes around 1hr.30 min .Overall in this price segment getting Samsung with SD 865 is a good deal. Do check for exchange and coupons discount.After July update overall performance has been improved including biometric unlocking. Heating issue has been taken care of.Edit: No issues of lag or app crash after 1 year. Sometimes phone does heat up.Battery Backup is moderate 5-6 hrs screen time with 60 hz.Frequency of updates reduced.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bikram Kumar Das,Waste of Money,Don't fall for it ifnthe seller offers you a good deal. S20 series in supposed to be the premium series from samsung galaxy series. But it fact you will dislike just by looking at the packaging. The box seal was half broken and the didn't even had its protective film covering or anything. Cheap packaging. Ignoring that I treid to give the phone a shot as I believed that it a good phone. I was wrong. Phone doesn't function properly at all. Takes ages to fully charge and then drains out in just few hours. The screen blackout was frequent and now the screen is completely dead. It is a refurbished or duplicate phone probably as other S series phone dosent do this. Comparatively my vivo x60 was more premiumly packed and functional like a new device should. This is a complete disaster. Please refrain and do not put your money here. It's not a small amount eithier. A big no to this device and this seller.,1.0 out of 5 stars

gaurav_347,Amazing phone!,I was confused between the oneplus 9r and this phone. Finally went with this one. I have been a oneplus user since one plus one till oneplus 5 then I shifted to honor view 20 and then to this. This is my first Samsung phone and I am truly loving it. I would recommend anybody going through the confusion of choosing between the oneplus 9r or this should opt for the Samsung. These are the reasons why I chose this.The cameras are great. Amazing pictures! The battery life is amazing and the screen is beautiful too. The one ui is amazing. Clean fast and very responsive like the oxygen os. Only a 15 watt charger is supplied with this but I believe slower charging phones are better in the longer run for the battery life. You can always buy a Samsung 25 watt charger if you wish to speed up the process. Fingerprint scanner is a tad bit slower but it's ok as long it is doing its job. There is only a few mili second difference between the oneplus and this. The phone is 5g ready and future proof with many bands. Samsung also promises 4 years of os and security updates. When you buy a phone at a premium price such as this you would want to keep it for good 2-3 years. Also samsung resale price is always going to be better than oneplus. When the time comes to upgrade the value of a Samsung won't go down as much as other Chinese phones. I got this phone for 34k with the discount coupon and the exchange so all in all a steal of a price. The phone is still learning what apps I use and what I don't and it puts it to deep sleep. This helps with the battery life. I am getting anywhere between 11-12 hours of sot with normal use. It only turned hot on the first day when i was setting up the phone but only for a few minutes. I haven't felt any heating issues what so ever. I would highly recommend this phone over the oneplus any given day. I have been a oneplus fan boy but not anymore. I will choose a Samsung over oneplus any given day.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Ankit Srivastava,Best Android phone in sub 50 thousands even in 2022,"I have purchased this phone (in 2022) after extensive research and trying various phones within 50-55 thousands budget & I do not regret my decision. This is a brilliant & no nonsense device. Exceptional camera, if used properly it can match (and even outperform) iphone 12 at least in still photography. Processor is perfectly suitable for my needs (I don't play games and all). Expandable storage is yet another very important feature, which has become very rare in high end devices now. Call recorder is in built, and the other person won't be able to know if you are recording, that has also become rare now. Next is very solid waterproofing, accidentally got tested in very heavy rains.  Further it offers v good crisp display. Samsung security is also much more assuring than Chinese devices.Some areas that you would expect to be better is: Battery - above average yes, but not at par with modern devices. Battery remains an issue in almost all 'S' series phones from Samsung. Other downside is very slow charger out of the box (nevertheless they're giving something at least). Next is form factor, I personally like more sleeker phones, this one is relatively broad and gets a bit bulky after you put a cover, still phone looks premium, nothing like deal breaker.Having said all that, it is still a very very very good android phone at its price even in 2022. If you are looking for a basic, hassle free, reliable phone with great cameras and expandable storage (waterproofing & call recorder - icing on the cake), go for it, you won't regret....and yes...try not updating it. And at last, please do not trust YouTube reviews / fake marketing hype of Chinese phones, they can never match Samsung and Apple's quality, I have experienced it on numerous occasions. Hope it helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

LAMBDAVELORUM,Great allrounder,"I was looking for a mid tier phone for around 30 to 35k. After much research I rounder up these 3 phones. Realme GT2, Iqoo 9se and the s20 fe. While the former 2 had the near latest chipset they trailed behind in the camera section despite having a 50mpx sensor. The samsung on the other hand has a great picture processing software optimization that keeps a consistent image throughout the the 3 cameras. The next point is the ip rating. For this price range there are very few phones that offer that. Next is the build. While I don't care much about glass back. Or rather worry about having one. I kina prefer a polycarbonate back that won't brake that easy. And samsung here has done a good job with their polycarbonate back. Next is samsung out of the three offers a metal frame while the other two offers plastic frame. And finally the 3x optical and 30x digital zoom is way useful than the gimmicky 2mpx macro camera for sure. Besides these points samsung has better after sales service and a big reliable brand.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Chirantana,"Overhyped, underdelivered, Not my best purchase.","The phone is overall good, Just good enough to not throw it in the bin.I had a galaxy Note 8 before this which was great and is still the best phone I have had. That was what drove me to buy another samsung, but this phone is a little disappointing.Whta I like:I love the screen, the plastic back doesn't bother me and actually feels nice to hold. The build seems sturdy and It is water resistant.Games run fine, the phone does warm up but doesn't heat up to uncomfortable levels. The UI is great, Speakers are fine.What I don't like:The front selfie camera has fixed focus and does t not have autofocus. You have to keep the phone about an arms length for good selfies.The back cameras are not the best in the market, but they get by.The phone doesn't seem to support USB to 3.5mm jack adapters and says usb not recognized.These small things are very frustrating, the charger takes 2hrs to fully charge your phone and no USB C earphones are provided in the package.Given a chance I would not by this again.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Ashwin Save,Seal was broke and cellophane tape was put on it. Poor customer service aswell.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The ideal Samsung packing with vaccum sealed plastic was not there. Most importantly, the product seal was broken and cellophane take was applied on it. It was clearly a refurbished or repackaged product from this seller. PFA images for reference.I had paid 1500 so that this comes from a prime seller and fulfilled by amazon with an expectation that an INR 45K+ would be a brand new & untampered piece. However, that expectation is down the drain along with trust. This is completely unacceptable and fraudulent activity.Terrible response from customer service as well. When contacted by the customer service agent, she recommended opening the seal & check the piece if it is ok. When I asked the intention of doing it... they replied if it's ok to use then you can use it. When asked how can you make such a suggestion when you know it's wrong and the customer has been sent a faulty product.... the reply was my senior manager told me.This is totally unprofessional, shocking, wrong, and unacceptable. Why should I, the customer, open an expensive item whose seal is refurbished and be satisfied with it. I have paid a large sum of money for a brand new device. The so-called senior manager didn't come on the call when I requested. As you already have recorded, I want this investigated, or else I can provide the audio.After a back and forth for 1hr, the issue was resolved with a replacement of the product. However, at this point, I have completely lost faith & trust in the seller ""Prime Benefit"". Kindly note I would be requesting a refund if there is even a single bit wrong with the product or the packaging for the replacement.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I did feel my phone battery was going down bit faster but it could have been because of my excessive usage of new phone and making more than regular videos.

I got it in 23.7 k so I went for it else had sworn that I will never buy samsung after throwing 30 k down the drain in 1.5 yrs for Samsung A 50 s.It 's decent product for this price..screen is very good and also it's camera is decent not as good as realme or OPPO or Vivo.i started facing battery drain Issues samsung service center reformatted the phone at hardware level to fix it and it did not work.Not sure if this issue  is in other phones.Phone slightly heavy and heats up at the camera with little usage.Screen on time is less than 3 hrs for sure.After Replaced phone is slightly better but still defective battery and speakers are bad than the earlier phone and the phone had scratches felt like a refurbished product but service center mentioned seems new possibly delivery related damage,1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,Phone stopped working within 2 weeks of purchase,"The phone was working fine till the time it stopped working all of a sudden. When I took it to the Samsung service station, they informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. It has been almost 6 days now and I am yet to receive my phone back.

karann,Value for the money,The phone is smooth to run . Switching from apple was worth the catch .The size and form facfor of phone is great . The camera quality is descent and processor does not lag behind for my day to day run . The battery life is pretty awsome . With full charge and on power saver mode with a heavy screen tike of 5 hrs it last for a day say at 10 pm generally at 35%The charger is descent it takes around 1hr 25 mins on an average to full chargeAt this price point water ressistant and wireless charging with reverse wireless charging is like addding smell to goldThe finger print reader is fast but faceunlock does work fine .mostly i prefer finger to unlock as maskedup makes faceunlock difficultAt 35k price point its worth every penny.Be sure the phone is brand new . Amazon sent me refurbrised phone first but on complaint they were pretty impressive to address the concern and changed the product .that made a bit of delay inhnad experience .Using the phone for alomst 4 months its a worth of exploration,5.0 out of 5 stars

Krishna Chaitanya,Good phone - Buggy OTA Updates,"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a superb midrange phone that has everything an ideal phone has to offerPurchased the phone directly from Samsung's official website along with corporate discount and HDFC card offer got the Snapdragon 865,  8GB RAM &128GB variant for INR 31500Pros1.Display is good, crisp images and not colour tones are good too.2. Snapdragon 865 does a good job interms of processing power.3. Sound output is good has a stereo speaker.4 Both the Rear & Front Cameras do a decent job.5. Samsung also promises 2 OS updateds & 3 years of security updates for this phone.6. Phone has IP 69 DUST & WATER resistant rating which is hard to find in phones specially in this price point.Cons The OTA updates released by Samsung officially are so buggy, post the update the hardware got damaged, when took it to the official service center they said this issue has become common in most of the Samsung phones.But the company denies to accept this.There needs to a QC check before releasing any update by Samsung. I am posting the condition of my phone post the recent OTA update.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Yash Daga,Only good phone under 50k,"The first best thing about this phone is snapdragon 865. This is the only chip which has optimised battery, performance and heat management. Other phones contain snapdragon 8 gen 1, 888, etc which compete against the sun in heating and consequently decreases the battery life significantly. 865 is the only good chip in the 8xx series.Second best thing is the one UI software. What a smooth and ple assante experience unlike my previous Chinese phones.Camera & sound quality are surprisingly good. Previously, I used only Chinese phones... So a big camera upgrade.Needs improvement: Fingerprint sensor. Doesn't register 3 times out of 10.",5.0 out of 5 stars

hozaifa ahmad,Worst Experience Ever,"After using for around 20 days it's display gone blank. Phone is in on condition when  incoming call comes it rings but display stay blank. Tried restarting and connecting to charger but not work then i reach service center he check and told we have to change the display but dislay is not in stock in any of four service center in my city then he placed a order and told me it takes a week to come diwali holiday is going to start so its also take sone more time i didn't understand what i have to do. Previously i  used several different companies mobile like vivo, honor ,oppo they all are Chinese companies but didn't face a single problem in last 7 years but after spending this much money and going for Samsung flagship mobile this kind of Experience i never expected. Mobile is good in all aspects like display, camera,sound but I recommend you all don't buy this mobile or any Samsung mobile they are just worst. When they stopped working you don't have any idea and in that you lost your all data which is very importance for every person. Don't buy at all",1.0 out of 5 stars
sshastry,Dont buy any Samsung mobile it has hang and freeze issue,"I wanted to buy non-Chinese mobiles hence bought this on 6 Sept 2020. For the first 4 months everything was working normal. Slowly the problems started to appear.Occasionally when the phone connected to wifi and you click on whatsapp the phone hangs, restart many times then work properly. Occasionally when camera icon is clicked the same thing happened but this time error screen at phone boot was displayed. I was forced to take my mobile to authorized service center. Everything was reset and for next 1 month no issues. Even though I installed very few basic apps this problem started to repeat. I checked across many forums and most of them had similar issues and point out at outdated UI software or hardware and software incompatible issues etc.Its been 1 year after I purchased this disgusting thing and request everybody to refrain from purchasing Samsung phones. Finally on 20-May-2022 mobile hardware crashes and service center advised for motherboard replacement which will cost you 8k. I lost 17k by purchasing samsung phone. You can ask your friends and its the same issue with Samsung phones.",1.0 out of 5 stars

kumar roshan,"Edited:- if there is low network frequency in your area, please stay away with this phone.","Actually this is not a review,  it's direct comparison between s20 fe and oneplus 9 series. and the winner is off course s20 fe. I am oneplus user from oneplus 3t, op5, op5t, op6 and the last oneplus I had oneplus 7t. after that I never found any satisfactory phone from oneplus. so I decided to go with Samsung. and the s20 fe is actually satisfactory and budget friendly. the one ui is very good as oxygen os. face unlock and fingerprint unlock is a little bit slower than oneplus but definitely accurate. and most important things the camera is awesome. I really didn't expect that it's camera is miracle. it's 12 mp is just a number but believe me the 108 mp of mi or 48 mp of oneplus is nothing infront of this. here is some picture of extreme night condition and night mode, the hdr and off course the moon. the night mode is just miracle. the only bad thing is the slow charging speed. I have 25 watt charger. but the charging speed is not like my last phone oneplus 7t. overall A very good phone in this range. thank you Samsung üòäEdited:If you have low network frequency in your area, please stay away with this phone. There is 3 phone in my home including this.The narzo 20 pro and mi11x is running good in low network frequency ( inside the house) but my phone is almost dead in low network frequency. And this is not happening in my phone only. Same thing happens in other s20 fe holder. Seriously guys if you want to use it inside your house  please don't buy it. I will upload the video also where in same place same network, other phone is working fine and my s20 fe 5g is not working.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Subrat Nayak,Excessive heating and adaptive brightness problem,"Ok, I had received two units, obviously one is a replacement unit. In both of the cases I found same problem.First, it heats a lot, even in regular usage. You will feel completely uncomfortable after 10 to 15 minutes call. Heating up while gaming is ok, but for normal usage like taking a call, surfing social media or watching videos on YouTube it's quite uncomfortable and annoying.Now, the display quality is good. I found it has less brightness than that of Samsung S10 lite. S10 lite never heats up like this. Another annoying thing that I noticed that while watching HDR 4k contents, it flickers a lot (when you move from brighter area to darker area or darker to brighter). When you fix the brightness to the highest then that doesn't happen.Rear camera is excellent, but the front camera is not that good as front.The problem mentioned above I noticed in both of the devices I received. I also found some other persons have the same issues and they discussed the same in Samsung community. At the end I returned the product.I want to thank Amazon for such great service. However, I haven't received my refund yet üòî. Expecting will receive the amount shortly. Thanks",3.0 out of 5 stars
Bhanu Prakash,Satisfied with phone. Look for coupons and exchange offers,"Been using for over a week. Good phone, bought with 37,000 no cost EMI, got both 6000 off coupon from seller and 5000 off for my old device exchange (the cost of that device was 13k, bought and used for 2 years). So I think I got a very good deal. Camera is top notch. The performance is also super, which is expected from Snapdragon 865. Screen is bright enough. I don't care about 120Hz or 60Hz, but having the option of 120Hz is good. No adaptive mode for screen, 120Hz is fixed. Hoping for adaptive mode on software update. Battery life is good. I am a medium user, keeps checking phone for messages, runs multiple apps like Teams, whatsapp etc. So battery life is Okay, not superb. But charging is slow( I personally prefer slow charging, coz it gives good long term battery life). Overall I'm satisfied with the phone. Bought this after a lot of research. Seen the reviews of OnePlus devices having heating issues. So decided to go to the trusted Samsung brand. This phone also has some heating issues. What I observed is it heats when the 4G signal is not good, and when browsing edge browser. Also mild heating while watching YouTube using 4G. So expecting Samsung to resolve this mild heating issue to some level using Software update.  Anyways happy with the phone and expecting to use for atleast 2-2.5 years. Samsung's gauranteed Updates is a huge Plus. Phone is also IP68 rated. So can dip in swimming pool too!!",3.0 out of 5 stars

And I can say that this phone has still got it.#Coming from an LCD to an amoled for the first time was a huge jump for me, and I absolutely loved it. The color contrast and the blacks are absolutely on point. And the smoothness is on point as well with the 120hz display.#The camera is also really good. You can take very good photos with it if you know what you are doing.#I love the quality of sound it produces. Mixed with the Dolby, I feel this speaker gives competition to a lot of flagship phones out there.#Battery is good enough, with total backup of over one day on average with more than 8 hours of screen on time.The only turn off for me is the absence of variable refresh rate, which would be just perfect, and a better finger print readability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Xavier,You can get nothing better at a price of 35 to 45k.,"Awesome phone from samsung, it has fulfilled all my wishes that I wanted in my mobile.Firstly I would say, this phone is completely worth for a price range of 35k to 45k. This phone is even better than S21 came this year in terms of performance in system & camera which is priced at 71k. So it's a bang for buck.Secondly I would like to discuss on the pros & cons.Pros: Almost Every thing about this phone is a pro :)Battery - Battery life is awesome, you can get SOT of around 7hrs on average, based upon your usage it may vary from 6hrs to even 10hrs. Battery Life could be increased by an hour or 2 by switching the display to 60Hz. 10 / 10Camera - It is out standing better than S21, oneplus, iPhone 12 pro max in terms of picture quality. When it comes to zoom capability this phones is able to do upto 30X That's pretty great. 9.5 / 10Display - I need not mention anything about a Samsung display, it is gorgeous. And now at 120Hz just ultra smooth.  10 / 10Software - You cant get rid of this software, once you understand and get used to each and everything that samsung has provided in its software. The main advantage would be, you need not side load any additional apps like cornor lightening and some useful features. 10 /10.Build Quality - It is pretty Solid, I dont find any problems with that. Plastic back is an advantage I would say. Glass back is more fragile. Even if the rear glass breaks, that would spoil your mood. 9 /10.Charging Speed - It takes around 1Hr 45min to get fully charged from 0 to 100%. Could have been a little faster when compared to the competitors 9 /10.Speakers & Dolby Atmos - Pretty good sound Quality, nothing to complain here. 9 /10.Cons:The only cons is they would have provided a headphone jack,  but it doesn't bother me very much. Atleast they could have integrated the DAC with the Type-C port.Overall rating is 9 /10.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,Amazing at this price flagship level experience bang for buck,Phone is Great üëç  but fingerprint reader could be better and battery drains very fast but it's been just three days let's see hoe it fares in the coming months moreover my unit was manufactured April this year so no issue of getting stocked phone though it maybe s20 but it's year's manufactured phone loving it while typing this haptic feedback is great just go for it once again thumbs up 8,5.0 out of 5 stars
Mrinmoy Biswas,Please don't buy this phone any more.,I bought this phone twice in this month and had to return both the time. Display stopped working after just two days of using.

suba,Very impressive device if you looking for premium mobile under 30K,"The battery life was improved a lot. If you use your device in ultra power saving mode it can last for 2 days..it's actually very impressiveI was looking for a premium mobile under 30k, before am using realme xt so it was hard to move on to other brands.. but if u got this mobile during the offer it's really worth your money..Am very satisfied with my purchase..and if you are worried about fast charging u can purchase 25w fast charger from samsung website and if u using 15w charger yes it take 's more time but I think it was okay..in realms I got 100 percent battery in 30min but here it takes nearly 1hr but for me it was not a big problem ..Overall at this offer price samsung done a very a good job ü•∞",5.0 out of 5 stars

Somanath panigrahy,Product good this price range,"I am invest 40,000 but no security app lock only secure floder1. Display is superb with 120hz and 60hz refresh rate option.2. Sound quality is good and loud from dual front speakers.3. Camera is having upto 30x zoom and other pro features. It could have been bit better for wide angle but night mode is sufficiently good.4. Comes with a 15W charger, but supports upto 25W fast & wireless charging.5. Phone back is polycarbonate which looks decent enough to hold. One plus 9 may look more premium with all glass back but will be more delicate as well.6. Snapdragon 865 processor is fast if not the fastest like SD888 on one plus 9.7. 5G support - will support around 9 5G bands in future as compared to just 2 5G bands of one plus 9. S20FE 5G looks more future ready on paper. More 5G bands getting enabled with software updates on one plus 9 is debatable and need to wait n watch.8. Phone is IP68 dust and water proof, which isn't offered by one plus 9.9. Expandable memory upto 1TB support not offered by one plus 9.10. Battery same 4500 mah on this phone as well as one plus 9 but latter comes with a 65W wrap charger.Verdict - GO FOR IT. One of the best mid- range segment phones from Samsung competing against one plus 9. Both having their own winning areas, boils down to one's own preferences.",1.0 out of 5 stars

For example, Your phone will be 6 or 8 % of battery without doing anything your phone will be switched off within 10 minutes. The worst part is if you want wake up the phone by charging with laptop usb or similar the phone will take at least 2 hours to start. The second thing is the worst service of Bixby(I don't know what is that) which comes with this phone.  Sometimes it disrupts you to make a call and restarting became a nightmare with that service.

I had ordered this device and I received a sealed package which had a faulty charger, I requested for a replacement and received a device which was a sealed box,  I am sure that the packaging is not as per company standards on the replacement device. After opening the box I noticed that:1. The charger and the cable inside the box was not in the proper position inside the box.2. the protective layer along the edges of the phone was missing,3. the loudspeaker Audio output was not balanced, Audio on the earpiece side was low.4. charger was emitting high frequency noise. I did not expect this from a seller like Appario retail pvt ltd, to fool the customer by providing a refurbished/repacking the phone. I wish the management is aware of all these malpractices.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Saiyem I.,Average battery life and camera,"Pros-1. Good display. But if you use it at 120 hz, the battery drains so fast you will switch back to 60 hz. Good thing is, its gorgeous at even 60 hz.2. Loud and Clear stereo speakers- I have stopped using my earbuds for the comfort of my ear and I dont miss them for the phone's inbuilt speaker is awesome. I use it for Netflix and YouTube. The stereosound is amazing.3. Powerful enough processor for daily use without lags.Cons-1. Not so great battery. The average screen on time is around 5 hrs at 60 hz with normal use.2. Above average Camera- Now this might be because I was using a Pixel 2 XL before this,but I believe this phone has got a just above average camera. Nothing flagship about the camera module except that non of the three lenses is gimmick. They are all equally above average.-Moving on, since screen size is a personal preference, I would assume you already want this size if you are considering this phone. Good thing is, weight distribution is even and the phone doesnt feel bulky. The back looks stunning although its not glass.UI is also a matter of personal preference but yes, there is no bloatware or on screen ads.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Also note there is no return option, which means Amazon doesn't  accept returns for over heating.Apart from this there is 15W wall charger provided although the phone supports 25W quick charging.

Mohammed Suhail,WORTH BUY ! THE BEST,"It's been 15 days since i using the device extensively.I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).First let me be clear , I bought ' S20 FE 5G 'with Snapdragon 865 , not ' S20 FE with Exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .This review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,Pros :1. Display :Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .2. Stereo Speakers :As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..Both the speakers are adequately loud.3. Battery :As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras :I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. Performance & RAM Management :I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 appsbackground at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .6. ONE UI :I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.7. Build Quality :Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. Future Proof :  The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.This is the best future proof device as of now.So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .Now let's move to the Cons.Cons :1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :  As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .2. No 256GB Variant :  This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3 :  Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.4. No headphone Jack :  It is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. No 25W charger :  It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.For the reference of Charging speed ,Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. Front Camera :  I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION :If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother youJust buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I also be sticked to replace my handset. But Samsung don't comes on that but they replace/repaired my handset free of cost. That's fine but if same problem occurs after 1, 2 or few months later then...I had to pay a big amount for which I'll be not responsible at all.I never trusted Samsung brand...First time tried to check and failed...Strange that I am not having a single product of Samsung at my home except this one.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amit Giri,Never buy this phone,I am writing this review after using this phone for 4-5 months.Pros- 'Samsung' be Happy that you have bought a big brand Samsung device.Cons- Battery backup: if you leave your phone at 25% charged at night then you will found it fully discharged in morning even if it is not in use.- Fast charging:: It's just a name in case if buy this phone. It takes around 5-6 hours to get fully charged. Disgusting just wait for hours even if you are in hurry.- Network problem - Phone doesn't work even if you in good network area at times.- Camera quality: being a samsung device camera quality is not that much good.- Raw OS : OS is completely raw you will mis many features and need a third-party tool. For an example individual app lock.Heating: Even while watching a movie it will get heated.Touch sensor : Touch sensor is pathetic you most of the times it won't work.So I would never suggest to buy this phone. Instead buy another but not samsung.,1.0 out of 5 stars

AJu,Value For Money Samsung Phone Ever,"I have been using this phone for the last 2 months. So far no problem at any point. It's not like the other phones at this price range.First of all software and user interface. Samsung is always better in that section. UI is smooth, customizable, and easy to use. It is now one UI 4.0 (updated on the same day I bought it (Feb)).Performance is superb. Won't feel any lag even if you play any game or do any function.Display quality is way better than other company phones. Fresh look every day with theme center. It also support goodlock used for complete customisation of samsung phonesBattery is average. If you buy for normal use like calling, browsing, social media, etc it will last more than a day. But for gamers, you have to charge twice a day. It supports wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Helpful if you have galaxy watch and buds.The most important spec about this phone is the cameras in it. You won't regret it if you are looking for a phone with DSLR cameras. Each lens in it is useful. Not like other phones with useless lenses.Additionally it is water resistant, supports dex, goodlock etcYou won't regret your purchase sure....",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hemang,Worst Product - Samsung is Loosing it Quality both in Poduct as well as Service,"I bought this phone on 26/9 and decided to start on Dussera i.e.5/10, to my shock it's display was not working. I gave it to service centre as my replacement period was over, they took 6 days to replace the screen and gave me back on 11/10, then again on 21/10 its diplay went off, I gave it to service centre again, I am still awaiting the phone i.e. on 28/10.. I must have written 7-8 mails to Samsung, even marked its service head but all I got was a corporate standard answer. (I was using S20 Plus which also had a battery draining problem plus display went off in 18 months, then too I was so comfortable with UI I thought of buying this - now really regretting).Here is my experiance on usage of 10 days :The camera is not upto the mark, battery draining in 12-14 hours of normal usage. If you use  camera, battery will go off in 1 hour, not ideal when you are travelling and do not have powerbank handy.Phones heats a lot during little long usage or just 2 minutes of recording.Only Positive thing about this phone is its Display and UI..Its not worth the price.I even checked S22 Ultra - it also has Battery Draining problem.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Night mode in indoor conditions works well, outside though the images can be a bit grainy. Videos can be shot in 4K 60 FPS. Coupled with OIS, the quality is superb. I highly recommend this phone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rohit Dutta Mazumder,A very premium experience at a very reasonable value.,"I am back to Samsung after 13 years and it did change for better. S20 FE 5G is giving me a very premium feel, not the flagship show off vibes but, exactly what I need in day to day life.3 cameras, none of them average, 2 with OIS, night mode needs more improvement though. Not at all impressed with the slow-motion, that one is pretty average. Selfie camera is impressive and the software based bokeh is fab!Snappy fast! 865 dragon does it's best. I don't need more than that anyway, not into fps based gaming like BGMI or COD, so can't talk much about thermal throttling, but in prolonged camera use or other heavy lifting tasks, it feels calm and at its place.120hz AMOLED is more than great. Samsung screens have no competition. Sometimes feels better than some other fruity phones. But, lacks adaptive adjustment of refresh rate, hence quite a juice sucker!The phone feels sturdy and nice to hold. I love the form factor, the aspect ratio feels perfect. Using it with a transparent case to flaunt the cloud navy back. It does feel amazing and premium when light shines on it. Its a plastic back, so one less glass to worry about. IP68 rating helps in sanitizing the phone inside out after coming back home. Dual stereo speakers with Dolby sounds amazing, it feels really good when playing some videos, it intelligently separates the voice and music and plays it from different speakers.One UI is the cherry on the top. But the cherry is not that sweet though. Its different from the flagship OneUI. It gets major updates for 2 years I guess. So thats okay. There are thousands of small tweaks and optimization in OneUI that make me go ""Aww, they thought about that too"".Oh the battery. Sadly can't praise it much. It feels too small for the whole package it offers. Using it with 120hz for videos with decent sound from speakers give near to 4-5 hrs of screen on time. But on the bright side, on moderate usage and some optimizations, I could make a full charge last for almost 25+ hrs. Charging is pathetic! 15W ""FAST"" charger charges @ 1% per minute (appx). It supports a 25W charger but that costs Rs.2000!! and the difference in charging speed is not worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Arun D R Dorakula,Good Phone great deal!!,Overall the phone packs a great deal at the price we are getting it at. Got it almost after 9 months after launch but I believe it's on par with S21FE which has launched recently. Moreover this phone comes with Qualcomm processor whichnis a tad bit better compared to Samsung's inhouse Exynos processor. Very satisfied with the purchase but seems like the piece I got was not packed well or was on display at a store because the screen guard seems a bit off doesn't look like brand new.

SG,Great phone with the flagship features that actually matter to the everyday user!,"Can be a direct competition to iPhone 12 but at a much cheaper price as iPhone 12 128 GB costs ‚Çπ84,900 meanwhile Samsung S20 FE 5G costs ‚Çπ47,900. I binged watched YouTube videos about S20 FE 5G and comparisons with other phones such as the OnePlus 9 and iPhone 12. Also, this phone is MKBHD‚Äôs phone of the year for 2020.Software:- One UI is amazing and Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone and have been regularly delivering on that promise by providing regular security updates since the last 6 months, according to my research through its reviews on YouTube. Regular updates haven‚Äôt been offered on OnePlus 9 as they tend to be half-baked and buggy updates since the last 2 years. Plus, additional Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Photos, Samsung Dex, etc. are also very useful.- Samsung and Windows partnership has made it easy to use phone with your windows laptop. Works fine and is helpful. I guess it‚Äôs the closest it can get to iPhone Airdrop and sync feature with MacBook.- 60Hz and 120Hz works greats and keeps the phone smooth. iPhone 12 only has 60Hz but it runs as smooth due to its powerful Apple chip.Hardware:- Glass + plastic back which feels amazing to touch and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap to look or feel.- Great cameras which correct colour balance, and sharpness- much better than OnePlus 9. Videos are also sharp.- Mic and Front Facing stereo features are loud and clear. No call drops or cell tower problems on using Airtel and Vodafone. Dual sim works fine.- Includes a charger unlike iPhone 12.- IP68 water resistant and dust resistant rating which is missing on OnePlus 9.- Wireless charging and reverse charging works great to charge wireless earphones and wireless charging mobiles. Meanwhile wireless charging is missing on OnePlus 9.- Phone gets slightly hot when intense gaming is done on it. But it‚Äôs not unbearably hot and doesn‚Äôt throttle.- GeekyRanjit confirmed from Samsung that it has 9 bands of 5G as compared to Oppo or OnePlus phones in this range which only offer 2 or 3 bands of 5G hence this is more future ready for any 5G band that comes to India in the future.Battery Life:- With the in box charger, phone takes about 2 hours to charge from 0-100% and lasts all day depending on normal usage of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and some light gaming.Price:- While a 128 iPhone 12 costs ‚Çπ84,900, the same 128 GB Samsung S20 FE 5G variant costs lesser at ‚Çπ47,700 and also has additional micro-SD card slot which can expand the storage upto 1 TB. There is no such option on the iPhone.- Hybrid sim slot can be used with 1 sim + 1 SD card or with 2 sims instead.Final Verdict:It‚Äôs the best phone to get in this range. Has a balance of features - much more than a typical midrange phone and also gets some features from its flagship series S20. It also has a bigger battery than its elder brother - S20. It has all the features to make a good all rounder phone and should be able to last 3-4 years with regular updates and 9 5G bands making it more versatile to be compatible with all Indian 5G telecom providers whenever they launch 5G service in India.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Abhinav Singh,Most value for money in this segment.,"After researching for months to replace my old workhorse MotoZ2force, I zeroed in samsung s20fe(exonys). But was vary of the processor.So when they launched the SD one I was Intrigued.However a price difference of 10k was something I didn't want to afford.So one day I got a 4000 rs coupon on Amazon so I bought it instantly.After cashback etc I got it for 41773, which is a steal. I would repeat, unless S21Fe is launched this phone is a steal anywhere under 45k.I lost my last phone due to water damage so IP68 protection was must which only A72 was offering.It also have many 5G bands but that should not be the reason to buy a phone at this time.The camera quality is good, see some samples.The image stabilization is great(see the moonshot.The sensor is not that great as my older motoz2force, but the software makes up for it.Also the 3x zoom lens comes handy in many situations.Display is great 120HZ is great but even 60hz(which automatically switches to 60hz in battery saver mode) is good and a normal user won't pick a difference.Fingerprints reader is great. In last 15 days I have not encountered any issues at all.I mainly use the face unlock which works most of the time.Finally, we Indians should start recognizing the value of software also and only the hardware specs. The UI is simple on one hand and highly customizable on the other.If you explore a bit then you can automate many tasks and increase the battery life also.Many people complain about only 15 watt charger in box. Well fast charging is good in many cases, but it reduces your battery life. And the 65 watt charging advertisement by chinese ones may see like wow but in a few months you will see how this fast charging reduces your battery backup and life. Call me old fashioned buy I am more than Ok with slow charging.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sanjeev,The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery,The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Santosh,Just ok phone. Using for almost 5 months,"I was using Samsung s7 earlier and switched to this s20 fe 5G. Since network providing 5G  upgraded to new phone.To be frank there are no wow factor with this phone.Few better options with Canera apart from it remailns same.Pros5G and network :Call quality is good , network reception and all is ok as par no issues.GUI and Touch :Typical Samsung bloat wares lot of unnecessary pre-installed apps. Make UI prety slow. Slower than lower end phone like realme with emmc!, which my mother is using!!.I really shocked to feel this.Typing and UI feel is 10 times better in that realme 5!.Camera:Only part I can say is better is this, Camera and features. Deliver as expected..Battery:It was ok till received recent OTA. Now it comes hardly 1 day. When new It used to come around 1 and half day.Wi and Bluetooth:Not observed any issues till now.Display:Yup, display is better bright and can manage at outdoor with Sun too.Gaming:Absolutely NOT.

Now that 5G is enabled by Airtel in Chennai, I changed the setting to 5G but it is not working at all. When I contacted Samsung customer service, the agent informed that there is some technical issue with S20 FE 5G phone and Samsung technical team is working on the same. They still did not identify what is the issue and how to fix this issue. It is not just S20 FE 5G model having the issue, agent read out long list of Samsung 5G models having this technical issue.

It supports 25w superfast charging but bundled in the box is meager 15w fast charging charger with type A to C cable only! No type c earphones as well.On a brighter side this cloud navy colour is vivid. So is its display! With 120hz HDR 10+ support.It has stereo speakers and a welcome move at this price point.Also it IP68 rated! And indisplay fingerprint reader!Camera is tremendous! No compromise even though it's a FE!Supports ful samsung pay (nfc only)On top of this Amazon's pricing for this is a piece of cake!To summarize Best value for money and complete flagship experience at a reasonable price!,5.0 out of 5 stars
vamshi krrish,Its a great device on this price.,Pro: Samsung ui is great.Rear camera quality is at its best.Front camera can be more wide enough.Battery can give 7hrs backup under heavy use.Fingerprint inbuilt makes it more premium.Doesnt weight that much.Wireless charging and power sharing makes it more awesome.Water resistant is believable in rainy days.Cons: i didnt find much. 15watt charger is taking 1percent/perminute which is also better. 25 watt charger is also same. I suggest stay with 15watt charger.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Why did I get each order defective is still a mystery.However, this phone is one of its kind. Grab it if you can get it at 37k during offer.

Nihal thankaraj,Best phone in this segment just go for it if this is your budget,This is review after 7 month's of usage and I am fully satisfied with the phone from the day one. The snap dragon processor is amazingly powerful if your a gamer then also it is good choice battery üîã back up is also good last for day easily if your gaming then you may have to plug it in-between. The fast charger is also good takes around 1 and half hour for full charge but 85% charge is enough for one day . It's look also is very nice gives a flagship phone experience.  The price gets low and high every time so look for offers you can get it low as like 26k . Build quality is also good but the side frames got scratches because of the phone case is used which was bit tight so some scratches.  The camera is just awesome good quality pictures and videos also zoom also quite well üòç . The software is also good no bugs smooth experience . One ui 5 which is also amazing. Speakers are also good it's good and loud it has a dolby atoms option also. And it has wireless charging which is rare in this segment and support NFC. one of the best phone in this segment good price and just go for if without even a doubt you will never regret it later .,5.0 out of 5 stars
Rishabh Yadav,Good offering at the price,"After using this phone for days. I can assure you that this is a great device for the price it is being offered.  It is an an all rounder phone.

Multimedia consumption is a bliss(due to one the best screens) and the performance is also good. The major pros of this device are its build quality,  cameras(best in this segment) and software experience. I would recommend this phone to everyone if it's available under 30k.

Yes, videos are not played good on this device.Charging takes several hours to be full even with fast charger. I have a Lenovo x1 yoga charger and I'm using that to charger this phone.

Great Battery life (getting 1.5 days with average usage)2. IP68 rating, meaning no worries of accidentally dropping phone in water or getting wet in rain.3. 128GB memory is perfect, which can be increased by using a micro SD card via the hybrid sim card slot.4. Decent camera quality5. Has Samsung Dex which I personally use a lot6. Supports super fast charging7. Decent display and processor, you can play most of the high end games without performance drop.8. Good sound quality during calls9. Optical finger print sensor is fastCons:1. Get a bit heated up when you play games for a long time2. No headphone jack3. Hybrid sim could be problematic if you are one of those users who use 2 sim cards and require more than 128GB memory.4. Back body is plastic5. No headphone provided in the box6. No super fast charger out of the boxOverall,This is a solid phone and I would recommend it for users who are looking for a balance between gaming, photography and your regular day to day work.Please do invest on a 65W or 45W fast charger and a good cover case.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But the battery takes a long time to charge due to which I started leaving it for charging overnight and still needing to charge for half an hour in the middle of the day.Also the software is not upto the mark. In case I use an app which uses audio, such as a messaging app with voice messages or even YouTube, i may not hear the other person once i get a call. Issue gets resolved once i restart the phone.

Although, it does last me for a day during weekdays.If you are into gaming, switch to 120Hz and you won't feel any lag in the phone. By default it comes with the 60Hz display to save your battery of course. Also, you can use bixby routines to automate few things, though I have not checked whether you automate to change display frequency.The camera quality is amazing in the primary camera when you consider mid range flagship categories. Color production in Night mode is good. It also provides 3x optical zoom and after that it is all digital zoom.They should have not stopped shipping earphones with the phone. They used to provide these amazing AKG earphones in the earlier Galaxy S series smartphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Vinaya vijayan,Received a defective item and no customer support,"We received a defective item, the phone is not even turning on. Also there are minor scratches and seems like an used phone. To add to the misery, amazon has recently changed their policy so that the exchange can only be placed after their agent comes for a physical inspection and the inspection itself will only be scheduled after 48 hours. As we were having festive plans we were to leave the town and now have to cancel the plans as they cant even change the delivery address. So basically need to spend extra cash for a backup phone, cancel our plans, go through the mental stress given by the least compassionate amazon customer care executives and what not.Anyways this would be the last time we are ever buying an electronic gadget from amazon. This might seem and odd decision but lately even many of my friends have faced similar experiences from amazon and they do not care any more. Even while looking at the recent comments/reviews seems like Im not the only one faced similar issue. Also note that this misfortune has happend from one of the most previously credible sellers of amazon, so I cant imagine what would be the case of the others. Pity",1.0 out of 5 stars
Ela,Performance sub-par,"I was really hoping this phone would be great. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a let-down.Cons1. The battery- would drain completely with just 4 hours of on-screen usage. Worse, it would get uncomfortably hot. How can a phone this expensive have such a mediocre battery life?! It takes a long time to charge too. The fast charging is hardly fast! You don't expect to feel an uncomfortable heating with mild usage in this price range, but that's what my experience was.2. The fingerprint scanner- was problematic. Its performance was patchy. Wouldn't work at times.3. This phone is relatively bulky. A size that big, it still doesn't have a headphone jack. C'mon4. The phone is a fingerprint magnet. It gets dirty pretty quicklyPros1. Beautiful screen. Fast refresh rate and popping colours2. Decent performance/ speed. Could handle heavy app usage with very little glitches.3. Excellent Camera. Photos were crisp. The Zoom lens was mind-bogglingy good.4. Good speakers5. Future proof- supports many 5G bands which are not supported by other phones like oneplus/xiaomiWould have loved this phone if it's battery performance wasn't so disappointing. Maybe I got a defective piece because it was draining very quickly but the region next to the camera lens in the upper back would become hot very easily. Sad! I really wanted to love this phone.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Michel,"Takes the saying, ""bang for the buck"", to a whole new level","I'm a person who believes that there is always an in between product. Excellent value for money yet enough features and oomph to match up to current standards. This FE (fan edition) perfectly fits that bill. It's got it all!Camera - crisp, high resolution and clear with image stabilizationProcessor - snapdragon 865 - fast enough to beat dom's supercharged dodge (kidding....but you get the point)Ram - 8gb. That's acres and combined with the aforementioned processor, makes a killer combo. Your brain and hands cannot coordinate fast enough to keep upStorage - large enough that it would take years to fill up (at least at the rate that I store data)Display - FHD AMOLED - would make your eyes drool (if that was biologically possible)Battery - good enough.  Lasts about 2 days with normal usage. Turbo charges really fast.All this combined with Samsung's oneui and the android os? Safe to say that this deal is sweet enough to give you diabetes (figuratively speaking)The only drawback, if I have to nitpick, would be the fingerprint sensor which is optical (which takes a 2D scan) hence, a little slower than the ultrasonic (which takes a 3D scan) however, that is expensive tech and cannot be expected in a device at this price range. The telephoto camera lens is 8MP meaning don't expect it to be as good as the 64MP sensor in the S21 (which is obviously more expensive).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shubhadeep Kundu,It's a really nice product,"Frankly speaking ,this smartphone can do almost everything you want it to.It has not the loudest but sweet sounding stereo speakers, a refined UI which adds to the premium feel and is also perfectly optimized for the 120 hertz panel , A great display which will fulfill your daily dose of entertainment, it doesnot have any HDR support on Netflix though.Moreover you get the ip68 water and dust resistance , which is really a very important feature  and none of the other brands are providing it at this price range.This is a Snapdragon 865 powered Phone, so no issues in Performance, it is literally a Beast .. For gaming though it may not be as Smooth as the One plus or IQ, it is also a 5g device which has about 11 bands making it totally future proof.The more I speak about the camera it will be less , as this smartphone can click a perfectly balanced photos and videos in any situation , has a consistent camera which can be completely relied on.Lastly I would like to add that this device is the perfect in this budget according to me, its just that no device is perfect and this too has some cons that are listed below;1. The in display fingerprint sensor is good enough but is relatively slow and inaccurate than other devices at this price.2. The Build quality is really really cheap, even my Poco X2 worth Rs14k has a premium glass back with gorilla glass 5 protection , this has a plastic back and a gorilla glass 3 protected front panel which is the most disappointing thing about this device , it just kills the classy feel of the device.3.Charging is an issue , it takes hours to charge as it supports just 25 watt charging as compared to the other phones at 66watt taking just 20 to 30 minutes , and samsung provides a useless 15watt charger as well which was considered as a fast charger 5 years back .Concluding , this is the best value for money smartphone under 40k and is a reliable device with knox security features , overall it justifies its name the (Fan Edition) it really made me a Samsung Fan now .Thank You",5.0 out of 5 stars

Wishfulfeather,Waste of money,"I bought this phone after researching for more than a month. Watched so many review videos of this device. It seemed like the best phone at the time under 35k category. It started disappointing within 10 days. Whatsapp notification are never available on time. I miss useful messages so often because notifications come after 30-40 minutes. Phone battery is a waste too. After 1 month of usage, I need to charge phone at least twice. From 40% it comes down to 0 within half an hour and next thing I realise is that my phone is off.I opted for Samsung because of brand value but the phone is not even worth 10k.They have reduced price to attract customers because it‚Äôs not a premium phone at all. Customer service is worst too. They just suggest to reset the phone. How can I reset the phone again and again when I have so much data in phone? Amazon says they don‚Äôt handle the service part. They just sell the phone.The face recognition is pathetic, fingerprint sensor works 1 out of 4 times. Okayish camera.But definitely don‚Äôt waste your money because of Samsung brand value.

Shreyas Tambat,Amazing Feature Rich Smartphone from Samsung,"Phone offers everything you desire. Good Camera with decent battery life for a day given decent usuage coupled with powerful SD 865 processor makes the phone future ready. Also, Dolby Speakers are superb. IP68 rating gives you peace of mind while using phone though it is raining heavily. The built of quality is decent with aluminium frame which makes it sturdy to use.Apart from usual features, it has some additional ones like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, One UI experience and much more. In nutshell, software experience is decent too for a Flagship phone.Now coming to cons part, the major disappointment is the 15W charger which takes around 1:30 hr to charge fully. The phone supports 25W which can bring charging time down to less than 1 hr. Also, the camera part is bit protruding which can make mobile wobble when placed on a flat surface. I have bought Spigen Case which takes care of it and gives you a premium feel. The phone also lacks 3.5mm Audio Jack and you have to buy a 3.5 mm to connect your headphones.Final Verdict :- Phone is a must buy for 42k and definitely beats the like of OnePlus 8T and OnePlus 9R.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung really explains through this phone that MP is not the only important aspect of camera.3. OS functions smoothly. No lags observed whatsoever.4. Body material is good and presentable. Although back is plastic, it gives a premium look due to matt finish.Cons1. Finger print sensor can be a bit of bother sometimes and needs you to be patient with it.Overall, it is a great phone to buy. Try buying it during the sales.

Ajit,Phone had manufacturing defect,"Though the phone is really good and I think one of the best in its segment and also VFM from highly overpriced Samsung, which is quite an unusual. It is a 2 year old phone still rocks in performance and one of best camera phones out there, it even beats iPhone 12 in versatility of cameras.But after using this phone for some 4-5 days, I observed something unusual while installing the back cover. There was a big gap in between the metal frame and the back cover. Don't know how Samsung calls this as a IP68 rated phone because the gap was so big I could easily enter my finger nail into it.I replaced phone once but the new device had the same issue hence opted for return. Here Amazon's customer first policy me and the return process was hassle-free.No doubt the device is best @35k even 40k but Samsung has poor quality for FE series. I will definitely be keeping my eyes on S21 FE for future purchase plans.",1.0 out of 5 stars

KD,Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue,"Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Customer review,Appario retail private limited selling defective and faulty phones on Amazon website,"Appario retail private limited is selling faulty and defective phones on Amazon platform. I purchased Samsung S20 FE 5g phone and after few days i.e in just 12 days only it started to switch off on its own, screen going black, Appario retail private limited deliberately has no product care policy with Samsung like Flipkart has. They just offer 7 days time to figure out whether the phone purchased is faulty or not, which is unfair to customers who put faith in online buying and spending huge money to purchase mobile phone on the virtue of trust. If you take this defective phone to Samsung they will not replace (since it's a manufacturing defect) they will offer to repair the brand new phone. It shows that Samsung knows that these new phones are defective and will have customers coming back for repairs.It's a scam where Appario retail private limited offer bigger discount to lure customer to buy defective phones and then Samsung will repair the same new phones. But ultimately it's the sale that will count for Appario retail private and Samsung electronics India.Great scheme to dish out defective phones by these two business entities.Shameful business ethics.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,A very good all rounder phone.,"This is a great android phone given the price point. You get a really nice display with 120hz refresh rate paired with a very good camera.  It provides really good battery backup. Camera quality is superb specially in daylight. Samsung doesn't provide Phones with Snapdragon processor in them, but this one is an exception. You will get 3 android updates. The audio quality is very good because this supports Dolby Atmos technology. The output sound have a very wide soundstage. I have an iPhone 11 so people who have listened to the iPhone sound they might find it not so direct or bass heavy. The sound signature of two phones are very different. You'll find a spacious audio in Galaxy instead of being direct and bass heavy. The only con I felt about this phone is the fingerprint reader. It fails to detect fingerprint sometimes and isn't that prompt. Overall this is a best buy within this price bracket I think. Better than OnePlus 9R or OnePlus 9",5.0 out of 5 stars

Rakesh Jain,"Totally disappointed - Heats too much, wifi signals drops, battery charge drops like crazy","After 2 days of usage I have found out that the phone is heating up too much which is casuing it to throttle which could be the reason of Wifi network strength dropping to zero at times and at other times it fluctuates very much. It varies from 300 Mbps to 32 Mbps without the phone or router moving a bit apart, this is very strange. Also, battery drop while using the phone is also crazy 2 hours or WhatsApp chat is causing a drop of around 30%. And on raising return requests amazon is sending fools in the name of technician who run the servify app that just check whether the connectivity is there or not and the guy had not listened to my problem neither he tried any other workaround. What is strange is he marked my issue resolved despite him doing nothing except for running the checks. Again asked for return again they have scheduled the appointment for today.

Jeet Francis,Best value for money phone under Rs. 40000,"Bought the phone with a bit of apprehension since this is my first Samsung phone and their UI experience. But it has been excellent to say the least.Pros :-1. Superb display. Nothing more to say. Sunlight usage is very easy and adaptive brightness works well.2. Cameras as is the case with Samsung are excellent. Haven't taken a lot of photos but the few I have taken have come out well, despite me being in less than ideal lighting condition.3. Battery life is awesome, though the high refresh rate being static and not dynamic can really drain the battery, atleast for me since I have everything except 5G turned on. My advice would be forgo the 120hz option and keep it 60hz with tweaks to display animations from developer mode. Feels just as good in 60hz with added battery life as bonus.4. Call quality and network usage via wi-fi & mobile data are working very well.5. Speakers are very loud and quite clear.6. Some bloat apps are present but they can be uninstalled or disabled. No adds on anything as of yet.  Have had the phone only for a few days and these were my observations.Hope this helps someone make a decision.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Srihari,Good premium features smartphone at flagship killer price,"Whats goodOne of the finest smartphones by samsung within 50k price range with flagship features.Battery life is good with 120hz refresh rate would get around 5hours in day on heavy usageEven basic things like call quality is good and stereo speakers are also fine. It's not too loud but yes it's adequately loud.Camera quality is top notch and this says huge megapixels doesn't matter, ISP and processor matters. Would love those pictures even in low light and artificial lighting. Selfie camera is ok/fineComing to performance as it's sd865 no lag I have seen. It's good for normal to heavy user (note: didn't play games on this device)Coming to software updates, this is where stepped up as I already have june patch update installed today.What should have been betterFinger print reader should have been a bit fastSelfie camera could be improvedCharger bundled in box is 15wt eventhough it support 25wtScreen brightness is not adequate sometimes especially in sunlight",5.0 out of 5 stars

Ravindra Kumar,"Great Phone, Offers best in the range.","Just loved it. It offers unbelievably everything what you could wish for. Writing this review after around 20 days of use.Well the major pros:1. Look wise the phone is awesome.2. Ultra Smooth UI, loved the One UI 3.1 (first time using Samsung ).  A combination of 120 Hz, Super AMOLED and Snapdragon 865 makes it awesome3. Camera is exceptional. OIS works great which is missing in OP. I have attached images for references:  a. Moon Image is taken at 30X Zoom just with hands without tripod, see how stabilised that is.  b. Night mode is ultimate, believe me it can capture what eyes can't see  c. Day light, colour reproduction is great. Loved the Ultra Wide and Zoom cameras, both do the job with perfection.  d. Videos are very smooth, and it supports 4K upto 60fps. Slow motion and Ultra slow motion both work great.4. 5G support is there with 9 bands, although couldn't test anything in India.5. Fingerprint, Face recognition works pretty fast.6. Used Samsung Pay for the first time, it is awesome and something missing in all others. Just added my card it that, and tapped phone to pay directly. It authenticates using Fingerprint.7. It supports 15W Fast Wireless charging, which works flawless.8. Battery life is great, When I am not using it much, easily gives 2 days (46 hours) at 60Hz display. There are multiple ways to save battery. Initially battery consumption was more. It takes i think 6-7 days to learn the usage pattern by Android 11. After that it puts the un-used apps to sleep and deep sleep. Battery life increases to almost double after this9. Feature I loved the most - the phone is IP68, I have tested it multiple times, putting under Tap water and rain. Just don't charge when port is wet. Phone will warn itself with a notification.10. Supports upto 1 TB micro SD through hybrid SIM slot, so 2nd SIM has to be compromised, so I am not using it.Cons:1. Charging is bit slow, not like dash charge.2. Wireless charging is also not that fast.3. Screen brightness is a bit low, compared to higher end phones, but perfect when compared to lower ends.I recommend this over OP, until you are only into Gaming. It is not jack of all, its actually a king, with just a compromise from Snapdragon 888 to 865.",5.0 out of 5 stars

There was no leakages. And service centre says there are dents on body hence it is not covered in warranty. The dents were apparently visible only inside there microscope. This is just a scheme run by Samsung.,1.0 out of 5 stars

B Jaya Udyog,Not worth the price,"Reviewing after three days of use.Please DO NOT buy if you are planning for this in diwali sales.The price might have been lowered but the phone is full of cons.1. The battery backup - the completely charged battery lasts only 6 hours of screentime (without games, only Instagram and Whatsapp). Behaves like a 2500mAh battery. Please don't buy if you expect a good battery life. This battery doesn't even last a day of normal use.2. The front camera - absolutely unexpected bad performance. No sign of it being 32mp. The pics are hazy. I tried to check if I have smooth filter on or anything, but no, the camera just doesn't work well. In extreme sunlight it works okayish.3. I can't download any sort of APK files, it shows a parsing error, I tried giving permission to install unknown sources apps but still it's not going through. For people who use Spotify, Netflix, etc apks, this phone will not allow you anything like that.Being a college girl, I only bought this considering the camera quality and battery backup, both of which are utter disappointments and I can't even return it now.Don't buy this, they are selling defective pieces.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Lalith,THE BEST PHONE YOU'LL EVER BUY,"OMG, such an awesome phone for under ‚Çπ30k. I have made this purchase after doing hours of research and watching countless videos on YouTube regarding the phone.It's much better than iPhone 12 in so many ways. The performance is sublime, camera is really good, cut out is awesome. And most importantly Snapdragon+Samsung, is a deadly combination. It's phone of the year 2021 reward recipient. I can go on forever writing about this phone.The camera is so good and has OIS stabilization to avoid hiccupps while shooting videos on the go! Meaning even if ur jogging and shooting a video, it will be stable upto some extent (not fully for obvious reasons).  I've tried this myself.Also the 30x optical Zoom is impeccable, shared some images of the moon. I guess I would see the craters clearly as well if the Moon were to be overhead, i.e. closest distance to Earth.Performance :The phone is a beast with Snapdragon 865, it's a jet. i.e. Blazing Fast. I use a lot of apps and use my phone continuously, and so far no hanging issues in 2 weeks of usage.You'll not regret this buy, and it's so much better than S21 Fe 5G as well , beats it in everything but display. But this is bang for the buck and has a better processor.Battery back up has been very decent too. Maybe it's coz of the Snapdragon 865 processor.You'll love this phone guys, trust me. Just go for it, although you'll get fewer Android updates as it's launched 2 years ago, the current one UI 5.1 is a bomb with Android 13 itself!And you can always use a reputed antivirus, once the security updates stop.

What i liked the most was its ability to take pictures in dark( dark mode) . One of the best camera in this price range.4. Battery: im not a heavy user,but for me ,it easily lasts a day and half.5. Speaker: due to stereo speakers, sound output while playing video is good.Cons:1. Charging: The 15 W charger( even though the phone supports 25W fast charging) supplied is quite slow when you look at the competition. We have one plus which gives 65 W charger !! And its insanely fast2. No headphone jack3. No case provided with the device.4. Finger print reader is average.

Salmann,Best phone under 40k,"Bought this for 31k and been using it for a month now. The experience was simply awesome. There are only a few cons to be noted.Pros1: as the company claims ; it has a pro-grade camera. It has a perfect camera set up with a wide main sensor,  a 0.5x ultra wide and a 3x telephoto lens. A very practical camera and no macro and portrait lens gimmicks. Back camera photography perfomance is exceptional for the price point.2: SD 865 handles all task with ease eventhough it is a2 year old Chipset.3: 120 hz samsung display with adequate brightness.4: knox security.  it may seem like an unimportant feature. But trust me it is one of the plus points of samsung. A samsung phone with knox security is the most secure android phone on the world5:  videography is also awesome on this phone. U'll get 4k 60fps both on the main back lens and on the front camera , which is something no other brands provides at this price range.6 : battery backup is adequate.7 : one ui is so user friendly and packed with features. Provides customization like no other brands could provide.8 : ip68 and wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Wireless charging maybe something no one's gonna probably use. But ip rating is the cherry on the top. Again another feature exclusive only for s20fe 5g at this price point. I washed my phone and no probs.9: sound quality of the stereo speakers are awesome. Also the dolby atmosphere works like charm10 : lots of camera features like pro camera , pro video , night mode with all the lenses,  super slow with back camera and slow mo video with both front and back camera, switching lenses while recording video(even switching to front camera while recording is available) and more.11:bixby routines; it is such and underrated feature . It makes the smartphone truly smart. It allows us to automate so many stuffs.12: other samsung features like secure folder , samsung dex(which is only available for flagships) , device care , samsung pay etc.....12 : network reception and  all quality is on pointCons1: A 15w charger provided within the box eventhough it supports 25w fast charging. Even 25w is too slow in 2022.2 : front camera photography should have  been better. The color tone is a bit on the dull side and not eye pleasing . Videography on the front camera is good.3: the display should have been a little more brighter.  I mean it is visible under direct sunlight , but for a flagship it could have been a little more brighter.4: no headphone jack which I already miss. For gamers , you'll have to either use a bt earphone with very low latency or buy a type c earphone or buy an original samsung type c to 3.5mm jack( I tried one from a local store and it wasn't compatible with the device)5 : back panel is polycarbonate and not glass. But it is a good quality plastic and doesn't look cheap6 : 4k 60fps recording is not possible with the ultra wide and telephoto lens. Only upto 4k 30fps available.7 : the telephoto lens sometimes struggles to focus.Final opinionStill the best option at this price point. Very good cameras and perfomance and so many features.go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Isn't it?!Internet speed--- The phone suddenly goes offline.. and you cannot download apps from playstore easily....perhaps a marketing gimmick by SAMSUNG to popularize it's Galaxy Store where no problems with downloading occur.Overall at Rs. 29000 it still is an overpriced phone by about 9000 Rs. considering the fact that other companies give better features at a smaller price...FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL BUY ANYTHING JUST TO FOR THE SAKE OF IT.,3.0 out of 5 stars

¬†S20 FE 5G (With Snapdragon processor):Pros:Using it for almost a year now. I especially bought for the camera experience. Timelapse, Slowmotion, Night shots everything is of great quality. 30x zoom can help in many cases. I even recorded a video underwater - output was surprisingly beautiful. (read terms on important specifications before shooting).Apart from camera: the speed, user interface, software updates based on user feedback, multi tasking, pre-installed samsung apps - all are lovely.Cons:Price is definitely high for people moving from budget phones (like me). But in this price range this is the best).Phone supports 25W fast charging but the one Samsung provides in the box is 15W adapter. (Worstu pa..)Not cons but could have been better:Fast charging is ok but Samsung can definitely offer higher speed in this price.Display brightness level can be improved so that screen looks good even in bright sunlight.The photos:Attached are some photos i enjoyed capturing using S20 FE 5G. Basic editing like cropping, color correction and sharpness were done using Lightroom Mobile. Hope you love the output.The underwater video:Attached is the video i recorded under water. (Edited using Premiere Pro). Tip: Clear waters with good sunlight and right camera position may help capture better shots.Please be cautious that using your phone underwater for too deep or too long will cause damage to the hardwares. Do not charge or connect to power supply immediately after you take from the water. The charging ports need to dry.Happy mobile photography! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5.0 out of 5 stars

The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10",5.0 out of 5 stars

Before realme i had a xiaomi phone, its OS was much better than the realme. But samsung is of a different level. Hats off to samsung.

NS,VFM Flagship phone from Samsung,"Writing this review after 3 months of usage.Will divide this review into pros and cons.First, the Pros:1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience.2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously.. I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products.3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great.4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point.5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately.6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience.7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing.9.5G ready with 9 5g bands.Cons:1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range.2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times.3.Average front camera.Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer.",5.0 out of 5 stars

No heating issue, it just warms but doesn't effect the performance at all.Overall at 40.5k it's definitely a good deal if u want an all-rounder phone.Don't expect more color optimization but the pictures are too good in a proper lightsource.",5.0 out of 5 stars

GT,A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.,"I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The battery dies within 12 hours and needs repeated charging within a day.3) Takes more than 2 hours to charge 100% and Samsung calls it fast charging.4) Very poor touch sensor. Isn't able to read fingerprints and also very slow at opening the phone.5) Worst service. The service center at  Bhelupur, Varanasi online shows open till 7 PM but on visiting I found it closed even at 4:30 PM, and the contact number was switched off too.6) Previously ordered handsets too had a manufacturing defect. At there multiple (around 5) customers came with similar problems with this same set. At that service center, service was really bad. First, they didn't know what to do. I have to do multiple customer care all by myself. Then I had to go multiple times to the service center just to raise a return request. And it took more than one month for Samsung to refund my amount instead of my replacement demand.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Placeholder,"Great Camera, Best Performance, Classic Display",Rare Camera is just awesome. Check pics I captured at Day and Night. 30√ó Zoom is great feature. Ultrawide is also good. Top class Video quality. Nice Display. I am getting good battery backup at 120 Hz RR as well. With 25W charger you can save your charging time so you need to buy that one.

Pallavi G.,There is no such thing called fast charging.  Overall  good build quality,If you  have already  used one plus(any model) then you will not  like Samsung  anymore.

The worst part is it got heated when its charging  up and also  it takes hell of a time to get fully charged. I complain  about it and they said to on the battery  saver it might help.i mean really  Samsung  .  I hve to keep the battery  saver  on all time and they advised not  to use the phone for longer  duration . I mean should  i keep it in locker.  Other  than that camera  is good but not the front camera.  No good selfies anymore .thanks Samsung.  I love my one plus,3.0 out of 5 stars

Ravi Sharma,Just an Ok Ok phone with lots of cost cutting.,I will first highlight the con on the practical usage basis.1. Very slow and annoying finger print scanner. Oneplus is double fast.2. Lots of jitter while scrolling on notifications. 120Hz refresh dont work in scrolling notifications. Seems 20Hz only.3. Frequent bluetooth disconnection with my TWS.4. Proximity sensor is faulty. Screen very often get ON during call and caught the accidental touch. Which results in muting and disconnection of call.5. Pathetic slow charging. Original 25 watt charger costs 1300. Does not charge fast with 22.5 watt PD3 Mi power bank. Samsung has made the phone like it will charge fast with only its own charger even though charger is PD3 only.6. No design appeal. Design does not justify its price tag. Old age boring design and not at all appealing.7. No USB C to 3.5 mm converter. OK. But I purchased the same from Samsung site for 699 Rs and sound quality is very poor.8. Stereo speaker on phone is not at all loud. Just Ok.Pros:-You already knows before seeing my review. 100s of online reviews can tell you the positives.Take away:- Dont buy a chopped down version of any high end samsung model which is S20+ here.

I used one plus 5t before this and it's camera is performing still better than this phone.2. The phone gets hot I.e. it has heating problem on normal usage.3. The battery life is not even lasting 1 day 12 hours. Plus with the 15 watt charger that comes with this phone  it take 2hors for full charge which is very slow.If u don't my review go see this phone urself in mall/croma/ etc and save yourself 40000.

It is perfect, no heating issues, Battery is perfect, If doing normal activities it lasts for 2 days approx. Obviously playing games will drain battery very fast but still I was able to play more than 4 hours of Genshin Impact with overclocked graphics and everything on max. No frame drops, smooth gameplay. The audio from this device and the speakers with Dolby Atmos are incredible. Screen and picture quality is awesome, the 120hz panel is extremely responsive.I love this phone. Cant believe it was this cheap I bought it for 36000 l, could have been 34000 with certain credit cards which I dont have, but still in 36000 its awesome.Oh, with all the specs it has a sd card slot, which for me is extremely important, so this phone is almost perfect, if it had a headphone jack, this would have been all that you needed but sadly no headphone jack. The only other complaint is the charger which is 15W and charges the phone in about 90 mins, they could have given a better charger but I guess the cost would go up.Ofcourse nothing can match iOS but for half the price and 628 GB of memory with my sd card, Im more than happy.

Scott,Received used Phone,I was really excited to open the package and found that it was a used mobile with hard scratch left on the display. Immediately reached out to Amazon support for help and it was really frustrating as they were transferring my request to multiple customer service executives and finally raised an investigation request for it which would take three days. Till then they pointed out that I should not communicate with them. Also the manufacturing date on the mobile mentioned is Sep 2021 and the phone didn‚Äôt even had one percent charge. Not sure if I can trust the support of Amazon ever again after this issue. It was really frustrating for me to spend couple of hours just for this. I‚Äôm sure I may need to spend more time with them once they are done with investigation. The funny thing was one of the support person asked to upload photos of the scratch and then another person who joined my chat said it‚Äôs invalid as i didn‚Äôt add my name and date on the image which was not communicated by the previous executive.,1.0 out of 5 stars

I already login to my google account in this mobile and also transferred sone personal photos from my old phone but now all these data lost bcoz mobile is dead.Sellers trying to cheat customers through delivering used or damaged product. I purchased many mobile from amazon certified seller and never faced any issue.But this time its very disturbing. Waiting for replacement let's see??Update: my parcel is not collected by pickup agent becoz mobile is totally dead. He says he can't pickup without confirming IMEI no.Very disappointing behavior by delivery boy. Then i called to amazon customer care They assured me for refund now. Let's see",1.0 out of 5 stars

Aryan,It's maybe one of the best your money can buy !,"I recieved my phone about months ago and I gotta say THE CAMERA ON THIS THING IS MIND BOGGLING ! I had few choices like OnePlus 9 etc etc but other phones were more on the performance side not saying the camera were bad but they were the way you would expect them to be but the camera on s20 FE (5G) dude I didn't not expected this , it's ü•ú  and the performance I mentioned earlier this phone has sufficient amount of power ! But the only bump on the road is the battery I guess , idk maybe I got the less capacity battery or idk but if this is the original capacity I would say battery runs out quicker than you think ! But don't worry if you don't do hardcore gaming throughout your day ( except few rounds) this battery will last you the whole day (almost) ! So yea if you're like me who wants the best of all worlds , go for it ! It has quite a lot of features as a OnePlus and Oppo owner , I'm very Happy with this purchase !",5.0 out of 5 stars

Anyway they rectified this free of cost, but in the process I lost all my data,contacts etc along with the initial screen guard.The phone is operationally smooth, but battery draining is fast.

Regular sw updates (every month). Only drawbacks I found are no HDR 10 support on Netflix/Prime streaming, no 3.5 mm Jack, virtual (camera based) proximity sensor instead of physical doesn't work well (accidental touch in pocket). Did not experience any ghost touch issues which I read online. Snapdragon chip gives great performance and phone never heats up using cam/gaming for medium duration.

Nikhil Mishra,Blockbuster Phone,"This is easily one of the best phone Samsung has ever made. The overall specs and performance matches that of flagships with a price that is substantially less. It's an easy recommendation and the best smartphone available in its sub Rs 50,000 segment.Samsung's build quality, design and display beats other brands and it also comes with a great camera setup. Smooth 120Hz AMOLED display with a powerful Snapdragon chip gives crazy fast performance on Android 11. It has LPDDR4X RAM and fast UFS 3.1 storage and there are no lags at all even when playing demanding games.Lastly, you get wireless charging with reverse charging support. I have not had any issues with battery so far and it lasts a full day for me. Some might complain that the bundled charger does not give you fast charging. At least you get a charger, and fast charging almost always results in battery degradation over time.To summarize, if you want a feature packed phone with flagship performance at a great price, go for it. I personally avoid buying Chinese brands and have been a Samsung user for many years now. My previous phone was Samsung A50 which lasted for more than 3 years. You don't get the software support, build quality and peace of mind with similar phones by Chinese brands.",5.0 out of 5 stars

All photos are very vivid, true to colours and look real. The telephoto lens doubles up as a macro lens. All the cameras capture beautiful pictures. The phone doesn't heat up, takes 30- 40 mins to be fully charged. Very good and fast performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon Customer,Flagship experience at cheapest possible rate,"I am using this phone for past one week and sharing my experiencePros:1)Camera: Very good for this price range. I was coming from mid range phones so this produces huge improvement over them. Initially i thought to buy S21Fe but it is nearly 20K expensive over this and there is not much improvement over camera. Sharing few sample shots.2)Display and Stereo Speakers: The display is beautiful and the stereo speakers make it perfect for watching movies.3)Performance: Very good performance in day to day usage. I am not a heavy user, primerly using phone to watch YouTube videos social media etc. So this one has more than enough power for this4)Charger: This is the only place where we miss the flagship experience in 2022. This one ships with a charger even if it is only 15W. No other Samsung flagship will give charger in box now. This charger will take around 1.5 hrs to fully charge, it is OK for me as i was using the same charger with my old phones with 6000mah batteries.Cons:1)Battery Life: I was using Samsung M32 and M30s before this, both had huge batteries and will last nearly tow day for moderate usage. Compared to them the battery backup of this phone is pathetic. Even with moderate usage it will struggle to complete one day. Even if we don't use it there will significant battery drop. For example at night around 15% battery drops(All this is with 120Hz refresh rate and always on display, i don't like to disable features to increase battery life)2)Headphone jack: I still prefer 3.5mm jack, but it is absent in this phone, Even the type c to 3.5mm jack adapter is not available from Samsung in any online platforms now. So i was forced to buy a Bluetooth adapter.3)Optical fingerprint scanner: Nothing great about this. it is slower than the physical fingerprint scanners in my mid rage Samsung phones. It is acceptably accurate but takes some time to unlock.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Talking to customer care teams who are transferring to each other.Not sure who is at fault. But this has been a pathetic experience.Latest: Got a refund. Amazon team was insisting on a replacement but given several replacements also were faulty insisted on a refund and got it. What a relief.

Prabhat Kumar Rajput,great phone @25k in great indian festival sale,"1) This phone has awesome features no complaints at all (ip rating  and OIS is cherry on top)2) the only cons is the average battery life, it is neck to neck with my 3.5 years old heavily used realme 3 pro despite of having advantage of amoled and bigger battery. but any ways my usage is light and easily get 4-5 hrs screen on time straight out of the box. it's standby drain is great in my testing 8 hours aproxx 4-5%, it easily lasts one day atleast  for me3) cameras are great but i think the front camera image quality very little bit lags behind for the name 'flagship' IM NOT SAYING ITS BAD BUT IN LOW LIGHT IT STRUGLES ALTHOUGH ITS A GREAT CAMERA COMBINED WITH SOFTWARE4) conclusion if you want a phone @25k with reputed brand then surely go for it , also your usage should be like only some whatsapp, phone calls, youtube , and few camera clicks then no issues, battery will hold up a day.out of the box got one ui 3 and latest updated to october 2022 update and noticed no downgrade in battery or camera qualityi think i've written short- and clear-cut review of the productthe above review is after 2 daysEdit-->After using device for five days my observation isTo increase battery life just enable battery saving mode excluding limit apps and home screen option there, and also sleep those apps which you rarely use and that Is the only way only maximize battery life as per my understanding (as per my observation  screen on time will be increased like 1hrs or so )I think sometimes device gets warm little bit without any heavy usage so people who has their work in field mostly outside might face some throttle issue ( i'm not sure )So conclusion I'm enjoying the device no major issues found within a week of usage if anything happens later I will update hereThanksEdit=>After using one month i think battery is now calibrated properly with 20-25 charge cycles and the screen on time is now increased upto 8 hrs from 5 hrs**Screenshot attached in reviewThanks",5.0 out of 5 stars

Samsung service center team communicated that since it has crossed 14 days it can't be replaced it can only be repaired. The initial investigation from the service technician was that it was a defective piece, Screen and Battery needs to be replaced.

Now when 5G is actually available in India got to know Samsung has sold phone without software needed to use 5G.Had baught a Samsung product after a long time. Always tried to avoid Samsung because of bad experience with many products before. For example Samsung refused to repair a high end 2012 model smart TV costing 1.5L in 2019 saying it's too old and no parts available. Really??

Now i went to new service centre and shown my mobile, infront of me they opened my complete mobile and said me that it was display issues, will sort this by tomorrow and u can come back by tomorrow to pick up ur mobile. So after listening to them i left from the place and after 15 mins later service centre team called me and said that it was liquid damage, warranty will not be applicable for this you have to pay for this so then only we will repair your mobile and will give it back to you. See how they are fooling customers and playing with them.  And I‚Äôm going  for legal action on this product",1.0 out of 5 stars

MansNotBot,MVP in below ‚Çπ50k price bracket,"I purchased this phone after extensive research (~5 months) of YouTube reviews as well as real ownership experience from family and friends of many phones in the 25k to 40k INR price bracket.I was able to get this one at 38k after exchange of my existing phone.Have to say that this is the best one in this price range and even under 50k.All flagship features that a person would want are available at this price.And I'm speaking from experience of having used iPhone XS and OnePlus 7T Pro of my own parents.Haven't faced any heating (or even warming) issue except during initial setup.For people who still aren't convinced, I will update my review after using for 2 weeks and then again after a month if needed.Edit (25-06-2021): After 2 weeks of extensive usage, I can still confirm that I have faced zero heating issues and very rare ""warming"" from this phone.One suggestion which I would make to existing and potential owners of this phone is to go to Settings->Connections->Mobile networks and change it to LTE/3G/2G from the existing 5G option.I'm still getting maximum 4G and 4G+ speeds without the phone having to search for non-existant 5G networks in India.For Screen-on-time, I'm consistently getting ~6.5 hours(Display at 120Hz), easily lasting a full day and having to recharge only the next day.P.S: If you are a hardcore gamer and are willing to shell out 40k+ on a phone then ROG phones would be better for you.In all other aspects, this phone takes the cake.P.P.S : If you don't have a pair of Bluetooth earphones already and don't plan on getting one either, just buy the official Samsung Type C to headphone jack adapter.

The performance of Snapdragon 865 processor is buttery smooth with no lag (Heating is not much...can be bearable for sure). This phone have proper 5G bands (9 bands of 5G).

neetish,Update after 1 years of use,"The phone spec is good. you do feel them in use. Like high refresh rate gives you a smooth experience. Fast processing of apps and all. The camera despite being 12 MP is good. One piece of advice is to use single-shot mode at the party or outings/gathering. Their AI will give you many good pics in this mode.However, there is 1 major and minor problem.The minor problem is fingerprint sensor works but little slow. So kind of annoying.The major problem is Battery life, I mean 4500 mA-H battery won't last a day on average usage. The screen is big and if you operate at 120 Hz, God saves you.  Even if you don't play games, it is not gonna last for the full day. So there are features in the phone and if you want to enjoy these specs you have to keep charging the phone multiple times. Fast charging support is there but no 25 W charger.I think this is deliberate from Samsung. They want you to buy the costly flagship phone. Therefore they introduced this one at low cost so that those who want better batteries will buy the costly upgrades.Update: after 7 month battery has degraded so nuch that if you watch A full movie, 50% battery will be gone.Update: Battery is becoming worst. I can watch video for no longer than 4.5 hours without charging. Official stats says, it should last 14 hr on video.",3.0 out of 5 stars

But definitely put a tampered glass and a back cover. Since it has gorilla glass 3 I guess and the back looks nice but the matt finish might cause slippage.The signal strength (3g, both support 5g though ), mic, speaker is good. The atereo speaker is great. Its ot so loud but the sound is decent and very clear and deep. So is the mic.The software experience of One ui is great as usual. The updates are frequent.Looks premium, has all the flagship s series features and sensors.Does not heat up in daily usage or while charging.

Dhiraj Patil,Fantastic product recommended for long term use,"I was a oneplus 5 user for last four & half years, but this time after lot of research (approx 4-5months) I purposefully bought this S20FE 5G. Even MKBHD recommended this Samsung Galaxy S20FE 5G as a Phone of the Year 2020. I got this product for around 35K after bank offers, and believe it, I had a great overall experience with this phone. Samsung has definitely improved and made the user experience very good. Camera and overall performance is really awesome. Even the device experience is flagship and you get all the features of a flagship device. I really love a stock android devices because of the smooth and bloatware free experience. But in India, only Oneplus provided a good near to stock experience with high performance until the official oppo-fication of Oxygen OS happened. I did not choose Motorola, only because I am a power user and some of my tasks require a powerful processor. Overall a very good experience from this device.

Jasmine,"Worst Battery Life, even Samsung online testing says bad or old battery","The phone was purchased 19.01.2022 and received on 20.01.2022.

Hence, online contact with samsung was made and through checking was done at their end.It was reported by samsung people that its battery is bad or is an old one. Now I cannot return the product to Amazon as the return window is closed on 27.01.2022.So guys please beware of online selling by ""fulfilled by amazon"" for its ""Prime Customers"" as you may get the old defective mobile instead of new one.

Harish Handigol,"Jack of all trades, master of none.","This review is after a month's usage.Battery - Bought this phone during the freedom sale and have to say that Samsung has finally nailed the battery life. After using their S7 for the past 4 years, battery backup is clearly a huge improvement they've provided. Charging speeds are okay, not great. Takes about 100 minutes for 0-100% charge.Display - This has a FHD+ display as per the current industry trends and the colour reproduction is accurate and does a good job in modulation of brightness in auto mode. Sensor calibration is great and rarely, you feel the need to adjust it in the auto mode. I found this setting more than adequate for outdoor use. Indoors, this display is too bright and goes all the way to 2% bright in full dark room. Display is no problem at all. Another issue I observed was this being a 20:9 display, 25% screen on the sides during landscape mode is left blank because very few videos are available in that aspect ratio. This is true especially true for YouTube. More content needs to be made in new aspect ratio for the full utilisation of this big screen.In display fingerprint sensor - This is a major drawback. Out of 10 unlocks, I had 4 failed attempts. I don't know whether it's fingerprint reader or my fingers, it simply doesn't work efficiently. I have disabled this from 3rd week of usage.Mobile size and weight - With Spygen case, this is weighing 240 grams and I personally feel this is heavy. But we don't have lighter phones like yester years, so no complaints on that. But the phone is a tall boy and medium or small palms will need both hands to operate it. I was okay with it.Plus, the IP68 rating is an added bonus apart from SD865. This chipset doesn't heat up for regular usages and does well for daily tasks. Haven't played any game so far. So, won't be able to give that feedback.Go for it if you can afford it and have sentiments against China origin products. Otherwise, there're plenty Chinese alternatives available for a much lesser price.It's a tough call to make.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I need to click power button for few times to get it back. But this time it's no luck, i need to take it to service center and ask for replacement.Update:The phone was given to samsung service centre a week ago, they are still waiting for the spare parts to receive to fix screen.

Outdoor brightness feels a bit less under direct sunlight but it's not a deal breaker.There will be slight heating issues when using the google map or camera for long time outdoor.

Praveen1908E,Worth every penny!,"Pros:1. I'm a photographer so this matters to me. This phone has an amazing camera. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the OnePlus 9R due to the telephoto lens. The 3x zoom is just so good even 10x zoom gives you some really crisp images. Please forget about the number of megapixels and all, never trust ""64MP"" or ""48MP"" to be a good camera due to just these numbers. Average user or photographer, you will definitely enjoy this camera. Even the night mode on both front and back cameras is just really really good. Most of the time it can capture things in a dark room that I'm unable to focus on with my own eyes!!2. 120Hz AMOLED Screen by Samsung. It's as gorgeous as I expected. And the notch is pretty small too, not distracting at all, tbh.3. One UI. I used to think One UI was ok, nothing great but after seeing One UI 3.1 (which it comes with) my viewpoint changed. It's such a beautiful, smooth and simple UI. And the upcoming One UI 4.0 update will allow you more customisation so you'll just love it.4. Updates. You'll get 3 years of Android updates and that's great for a 40,000 phone.5. Build quality. It may look simple but once you hold it, it just feels premium. The cold aluminium, and the compact backside, it just feels great every time I remove the case.6. The performance is also really good. You don't really need a Snapdragon 888 tbh cuz 865 will give you everything you want. Gaming, video editing, it will do it fast and well. And not much heating, just slightly warm while playing games, almost unnoticable.7. IP68 rating. You can literally wash this thing like you wash your hands and nothing bad will happen.8. This may sound dumb but I appreciate the slower 15W charger because (a) it's not THAT slow, and (b) it will prolong the battery life in the long run if you don't use a super fast charger. The capacity will remain mostly intact throughout the 3-4 years that you use due to any slow chargers.9. The stereo speakers are surprisingly crisp and clear. Even music can be easily enjoyed on it, there's good bass and all. And if you're in a quiet room, even better.Cons:1. The battery life is honestly not that great. It's not horrible but I expected better. Even with battery saver I'm not getting much. But it's not a huge deal because the battery definitely is still reliable and good, it's just not great.2. Haptics are very boring and even budget phones give better vibration while typing and all. But this is kind of a nitpick since it doesn't make a huge difference tbh.3. Lack of headphone jack. Using a dongle just gives me less quality and it's a bit annoying to carry around. And wireless buds of good quality are just twice as more expensive as good quality wired headphones/earphones.Overall, I'm just really happy with this phone and I'm very glad I got it. And if you're considering S21FE, just skip it. There's honestly no real difference and the price is 14,000 higher.Hope I helped üôè",5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Customer,Value for money Flagship!! Go for it,"For long time wanted to go for a flagship phone, but couldn't go due to budget constraints.In Prime day sale, when the price dropped to Rs 30k ( 4 k coupon and 1k bank discount), i decided to go for it.Camera: This is the best part. Video with 60 fps are worth noticing. The Telephoto lens is much of practical use than those micro camera. I have shared 3 pics . The Hornbill captured in digital 10x zoom, was almost 70-80 meter far from my terrace.Another is night mode captured at 8 pm and third one is 3x telephoto zoom.Brightness is good, battery backup is also good 5-5.30hrs for continuous on screen time.In hand feel is premium even though the back is off plastic, but the alluminium metal frame makes for it.Dual Stereo sound output is great, less bass but gives a complete music experience.Haptic feedback could have been better and is not at Flagship level.Display quality is also good.Overall if your budget is around 30-32 k go for it without any hesitation.

Very much advanced and impressive.One of the best in the segment.Display- butter smooth display. Will enjot it.Processor- As i said SD 865 is superb if you are not core gamer, btw i am a normal user who felt that this is more than sufficient.Heating issues- So far so good, No heating issues till now. Pretty much impressed with its cooling capacity.Battery- Even though its 4500mAH battery seems to be low, it last for a day and more for a normal user. If we use camera very much ,the battery consumption also increases which is very much common in almost all flagship camera phones.Expandable memory- we can use sd card upto 128gbCons:Charger- 15W charger is not that superfast but you can use a 25W charger for a better charging speed.No audio jack- like many of new gen phones,there is no audio jack, instead we have to use c type earphone or c type converter or bluetooth for this.Front camera- even though 12mp rear camera is flagship , the 32mp front camera is nothing special, just an ordinary selfie camera.Fingerprint sensor is not ultrasonic but ok.After just one week , i felt the phone to be very much budget friendly and economical.In two words QUALITY DELIVERED....",5.0 out of 5 stars

In hand feel is premium, definitely flagship level.- edit -Now used this phone for a month. Camera quality is just great, dont listen to bad camera reviews. Battery is not good with 120hz always on.

Customer,Unable to detect SIM and loses network frequently,"Not even a complete year of use and the Mobile is frequently losing network and unable to detect SIM eventhough it shows the network signal symbol on the Top.Only way to discover the phone has lost network is when you try making a call or someone who tried calling you, tells you personally that your phone is unreachable (which could be a big issue in case of emergencies).Only suggested options to temporarily fix network is Restart, Remove and reinsert SIM or as suggested in some videos- Reset network settings (which will require to again put in your wifi creds and other settings you would have set before the Reset)Overall the Mobile is good but if it can not serve the basic purpose of having a phone (To Call specially, in case of emergencies) then there's no point in paying so much for this.Always preferred Samsung brand but this is not the 1st instance of facing such issues with their high end-mobile, disappointed.",3.0 out of 5 stars

¬†Best thing about this phone is that it gives you a great flagship experience in such a price point... As it runs in one UI interface which makes the phone completely buttery experience.... No doubt it has one of the best camera in this category and over-all almost everything is good about the phone except the cons (personally for me) is that the charging could've been little fast,  another thing is the finger print reader is really slow which can be annoying sometimes and lastly the front camera is not great at all... But after you install gcam in your phone you can have little better results in front camera.... Overall it's a really good phone in this category... So if your priority is more into software experience and camera than definitely go for it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

It's got the same specs of the S20 with just a few cosmetic compromises that i don't care about. My usage of the camera is very high because i shoot a lot of travel videos and that has been extremely good for the price i paid. I have made at least 3 other people buy this phone and highly recommend it.

My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well.

Narasimha,really it's TRUE of my usgse if you want better battery life don't go for this mobile,After using 10days completely I wrote this feedback really it's TRUE of my usgse if you want better battery life don't go for this mobile its only 5 to 6 hours screen on time and if you want to use continously it will come only 5 hours mostly this is main draw back for this mobile.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Chandra,Worth every penny!,"From iPhone 6 Plus to Samsung Galaxy S20 FEThe Good:- Excellent for multitasking ( I edit videos and photos)- Great for photography and videography- Dedicated PRO Camera option for video & phone- With 8 GB RAM it's lightning fast. I brought the mobile almost a month back and never had a lagging issue- Display brightness is quite satisfactory while using outdoors- Excellent stereo audio while listening to music on speaker. Also, it's loud (in a good way!)- Fingerprint scanner is fast and till date it never failed once to read!- Samsung Dex is just brilliant!- Excellent front facing camera- You can easily switch between front and rear camera while making a video!- Android and One UI works well- 15W power brick is provided and it works fine for me- Comes with a screen protector- Premium quality design ( I know it's plastic back but you gotta feel it to know it's built well)- Overall weight of the phone is excellentThe Bad- No 3.5 headphone jack!- If you have kept the scene optimization on while shooting evening sky you get a blue image. Like adding a blue filter to the image and it's annoying- While shooting video there is a heating issue.  It's manageable yet for this price and specs it should not be happening- No back cover provided with the box.- Face unlock works 5 times out of 10. If you are sitting against light it won't work. Same goes for night too- If you use the refresh rate as 120hz the battery is going to drain in 3h time. Having said that the optimized refresh rate is smooth as butter so it's up to you.The Ugly- None!!!This is a great phone for everyone if you have a budget of 40K. I got it for 41K.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Factory reset and Software updates did not work. Service centre says this may be a motherboard or display issue.Purchased this mobile because I did not want to take chances with cheaper alternatives.

Vikramjit singh,Awesome phone with almost flagship like features,Phone is very awesome. Its 120hz touch rate is just mind blowing. Very smooth experience with almost no lag. Moreover the experience of Amoled is excellent as we all know about Samsung displays. Let's talk about camera. First of all there are almost all modes in camera app and the quality of camera is not so excellent but it not so bad. It's a nice camera with option of 4k in both front or back camera with 60fps.For gaming this phone is not for pro level gamers as it is able to play BGMI on highest setting but you will face some lag. Rest phone is very nice you must buy this one if you are looking for good phone around 35k because company matters and Samsung is a nice brand.At last I would like to say that I am very much happy with this purchase,5.0 out of 5 stars

Ashutos p.,Utterly Disappointed,I am a big fan of Samsung mobile but this model utterly disappointed me.1. Battery life is not acceptable need to charge twice a day and also charging is too slow. I have another Samsung phone having 6000 mah battery it charges faster than this 4500 mah2. Signal and connectivity issues are there. I have tested my sim in other make mobile I would easily get 4 to 5 Mbps speed but in Samsung only 900 Kbps was max at that particular location. Being a 5 G phone this is what not expected.3.

My mobile is under warranty, and there is a minor dent in the mobile body. The service center people mentioned that though the display issue is due to the Samsung software update, I have to pay the amount for the display replacement (around 10,000 Rs) because there is a dent in the metal frame.

Just gets a little warm when you are playing call of duty mobile, apart from that no heating or warm issues while using it. Battery is well okay and last 1 day after playing game , watching YouTube, Netflix, on phone call, using 60hz display and without turning on battery saver mode.Regarding fingerprint, it feels very very slight delay, but if you turn off the fingerprint animation and change 1 more setting then it's much better, but I feels OnePlus 5t fingerprint is fast compared to s20 FE 5G.If you turn on the battery saver mode on then it last for more than 1 day 5 hrs or more, depending on how you use it.On camera, I am happy with it.

Inline what the reviews showed. Pretty much flagship class photos. No complaints from me there.The width of the phone could have been a tad bit wider, but whatever, everything else is pretty good so I'll let that slide.The price, now this could have been cheaper given this is atleast 2 gens behind what's class leading in the market place today so I took off 1 star for that.The lack of a 3.5mm jack would be another star off but this is the unfortunate trend with phones everywhere these days so am not doing that today.Overall it's in line with my desired level performance and features from Samsung and especially Qualcomm, I'd buy this anyday over some PRC rubbish.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Won't even stay for a day.- there is no inbuilt app locker. So if you want to lock apps using a different lock other than the screen lock, then it is not possible.

Ankit k.,Very bad batteryüò°,Witing this review after using it for more than  two months. Camera is good. Fingerprint average. But battery backup is worst. Initially it took one and a half hour to get fully charged but now it's taking more than two hours and the phone is getting very hot while charging and sometimes while using also. Initially with normal use the battery lasted for more than a day but now in just two months it has degraded drastically. It doesn't last more than twelve hours that too with 60 hz refresh rate.

Prof. Pratik,Decent phone to start your 5G journey,"After using for more than 6 months, my views on this model--Pros1. A flagship Samsung phone at a price of mid range smartphone.2. Recent models come with protector screen.3. Amazing battery,  you can set it to 85% maximum charging capacity for prolonged battery life.4. Latest android update.5. Decent cameraCons1. The major drawback of this model is that the processor is actually 4G with 5G compatibility. Not a true 5G processor.  I have a JIO 5G Sim as primary and BSNL as secondary.  In 5G mode, often  the primary Sim gets automatically disconnected , which needs to be recognized manually again from the SIM card menu. No such issue in 4G mode. Don't know whether it is a common problem or specific to my set only.2. Camera is decent but not extraordinary.3. Fast charging through original Samsung chargers only.  Not compatible with other brand fast chargers (not even with iPhone or one plus).Overall,  if you can bear with occasional disconnection of your 5G Sim,  this phone,  at it's present price band is decent. However,  if you can stress your budget a little,  then go with S21FE which has a true 5G processor.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.

Jithin James,After using 2 weeks,Best qnd value for money phone from Samsung.According to price IQOO7 & Oneplus 9R are competitorsNo doubt phone is very good display best in class and performance is adequate. Battery backup is also good. This one lacks cooling system while playing games like other competitors and charging speed is very low it takes more than one and half hour to charge. If you are looking for best phone and value for money from Samsung this is the best choice. This phone is average in every segment and best according to the price segment if you have game definitely you can go with IQ 7 or 9R or else why you are looking for well maintained phone and this phone gives you wireless charging and it is water resistant which is missing on competitors phone so this is mixed review about this phone,5.0 out of 5 stars

Deeksha Banerjee,Had a very horrible experience,"I received this item on the 27th of September and after using it for 15 days my screen went black without any symptoms of malfunction on the 12th of October. I took it to the nearest service centre where they kept it for 3 days, saying they needed to analyse what went wrong. Later, I insisted them to replace the item as it has been bought recently and such a defect has occurred.  They explained that there was a manufacturing defect in the motherboard which will be replaced and in future, I shall not face any issue as such.My concern was after spending such a huge amount on the phone if I am facing issues after 15 days, then I might face similar issues in future as well.The service centre squarely refused my request for replacement and said that SAMSUNG has 14 days replacement policy and AMAZON has 7 days replacement policy and both the tentative days have crossed, hence the device cannot be replaced. This experience is quite disappointing for me being a loyal customer of Amazon and Samsung.Talking about the features of the phone, the camera quality is excellent and the processor is quite decent. Even though the battery life is okay but the manufacturing and service centre has disappointed me a lot.I request Amazon and Samsung to get my device replaced at the earliest.",1.0 out of 5 stars
A Buyer,Black screen of death,"Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Abin,Terrific Purchase,Display:The display has a Super Amoled Panel. It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth. But there is always stutter because of the Adaptive Refresh Rate.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the Indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chip set. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.,5.0 out of 5 stars

They want me to pay 8K for repair and they didn't even have a spare - wanted me to leave the phone for 3-4days.I can go to consumer court, but in India it is just a waste of time.

Kindle Customer,Balanced phone.... Liked it after using it for around 35 days,"Good balanced phone as per my requirements.Pros -1. SD865 / 8 GB DDR4 RAM / UFS 3.1 storage along with highly optimised One UI ( currently at version 3.1) makes the everyday experience smooth. If you are coming from 60 Hz refresh rate phone, you will be able to feel the difference on 120 Hz, especially in social media apps, large webpages etc.2. I got this at 33K, as per my observation, this is the best camera under 50K for photos. For videos probably Iphone 12 will be ahead though. However no complaint about the photos. All 3 cameras (wide / UW / telephoto) work well, no useless gimmick 2 MP lens here. Impressed with UW specifically as it doesn't deviate quality wise from the main wide sensor. Front camera is fine, but I am not into selfies, so doesn't matter much for me. It works well for video calls via Teams/ WebEx etc.3. Wireless Samsung Dex is available here and I love it. Used it for some urgent office work and it was seamless. Love the optimization of MS Office, Outlook and Chrome. Most Samsung and Google apps also well customized in Dex. However other 3rs party apps may not always be best suited. Also you can easily multitask in Dex mode which may be awkward doing from phone due to small size.4. I usually get SOT around 6 hours @120 Hz refresh rate. It will probably be over 7 hours at 60 Hz, but why downgrade. BTW, I don't play games at all.5. No heating issue at all. Some heating may appear in case you use the camera for extended period, which is expected, but the heat dissipates quickly as well.6. All OTT apps work well as I checked just to test. But I don't really watch content on phone except for YouTube.7. No issue with LTE or Wifi connectivity.8. Stereo speaker works well.9. Monthly security updates as promised. Also this phone should get major software update till 3 years, so expected to get Android 12/13/14. No complaint here, Samsung has totally upped their game about Software update in last 2 years.Cons -1. The phone supports 25 Watt charging, but comes with only a 15 Watt charger.... Come on Samsung, don't cut corners here.2. Plastic back, which is not an issue for me as I use case anyway. But some people may not like it. At least the side frames are made of metal.3. The fingerprint scanner is not slow, but could've been faster.4. Haptic is okay, but could've been better.5. Despite of having and excellent OLED screen, would've liked if the display was little more brighter.My overall impression is this is a great choice around 40K for office and productivity oriented people, but won't suite gamers. In case any further update, will edit and update the review.Thanks for reading. Hope you have a nice day.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Camera: Please don't go with the camera mega pixel and sensors specifications.. it's all just a number, in the end it only matters how good the picture is. Samsung is way way better than OnePlus in this aspect. Added few examples above.2. Display: 120 hz super amoled display by samsung, what else you want.3. Sound: crisp and clear with dual speakers..4. Battery: easily it gives me 10 hrs on screen back up, not a gamer though.Cons:1. 15w charger is just less imo, 25w would have been ideal.2. Brightness could have been more, not a major problem though.3. Very new to one ui, but as per the initial impression oxygen os was better.4. Fingerprint reader could have been better.Edit:OneUI is awesome.. may be oxygen os is simple and easy to use..but one UI has lot of useful features based on AI.

I got it during Amazon sale with a special discount from Samsung, and it is really worth it. There is no need to go for the s22 after having this phone.One word of caution - it comes pre installed with screen protector, and does not come with a case in the box. The spigen tough armor goes well with it, but please do not order the spigen tempered glass, going by samsung's product description that it does not have screen protector.You will also have superfast charging performance if you get a 25w samsung pd charger and good quality c to c cable, and samsung wireless power bank.

Ashok Thakur,Decent phone,"I'm writing a layman's review after 6 months of use.1) Display- The screen size is comfortable to hold and easily fits in your pocket and  afcourse it's amoled.2) Camera- The camera is pretty descent though sometimes the colour is gaudy giving it an artificial look.Although it boasts of 30x telescopic lens yet the shots are blurry, marring the exact purpose.3) Face recognition - I'll give 4/5 for this feature reason being that  sometimes it fails to do so especially when you use it for the first time on a new day. No complaints for the finger print sensor.4) Battery- The Battery at 4500mah is pretty average . It'll easily last you a day on usage of 1 to 2 hrs. Recently, I have noticed that if you are on 5G network , the Battery drains still faster.5) Software- The software is nice and you are qualified to get at least 2 year updates which xiomi rarely provides you with.6) Verdict- Although I'm not qualified to give a verdict yet ovrerall l feel that it's an average fan for a casual user.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Sk Murshed Alam,A Flagship Killer,"Writing the review after 3 months of usage.The phone a beast to be honest.I bought this phone during diwali offers after i broke my OnePlus 7T.At first i was skeptic about shifting to samsung as i was a oxygen Os admirer.But after using this, i am very impressed. So the review goes as below.pros:1. Camera: Samsung has put all the flaagship level features in this 12MP camera. It beats even the higher MP cameras in this segment. Please check out the single take feature and Labs in camera.2. OneUI: oneUI has improved a lot and there are small customisation which i liked a lot.  For example, the secure folder feature, quick share and nearby share, samsung flow app if you want to link it with tablets, samsung pay and samsung pass3. Knox security: the name speaks for itself4. Battery: the battery last for one day on heavy usage and 1.5 days with moderate usage.Cons:1. Fingerprint reader could have been better.2. 15w charger is a joke. I had bought a 25W charger separately. It does the job well.Overall this phone offers Flagship level features at a budget friendly mid range price.  Totally satisfied. If i ever upgrade, it will be a samsung phn given One plus phones are going downhill",5.0 out of 5 stars

One UI has loads of features. Camera is simply Awesome.

Priyanka Mangaraj,Good product,Just be aware about the audio jack thing. You might have to buy wireless earcods / airpods. Also the HDR10+ quality videos aren't very much feasible for other usual editing apps unless some computer softwares are used resulting your videos might get white washed while sharing in some platforms ( saturation faded). Suggestion - shoot video switching off the hdr10+. Else always share from gallery to help convert the videos while sharing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Naveen Chandra,"Good smartphone for low to medium daily usage. Not for vlogging, selfies and gaming.","If you need a very reliable phone for calls, taking photos and videos (not selfies), browsing web and email, streaming videos etc., then this phone is an excellent choice.It's screen is good and fluid, colors are accurate and brightness is decent. Many people have complained about screen having issues but mine has been perfect.All three cameras on the back are very good and will not disappoint. They are better than brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo at similar prices. Selfie camera is bad and has no auto-focus on a hardware level and takes blurry pictures even in well lit conditions.Speakers are good.Call quality is good.Battery life is average.Haptics are good. Not iPhone level but good.Performance is very good. It's snapdragon 865 processor is no slouch. It can handle everything with ease. But it can get warm in heavy tasks for prolonged period of time.Samsung Dex is amazing.The charger provided with this device is 15 watts. It charges slow compared to other brands. If you buy 25 watt charger, charging speed will be better but not that much.Overall a very good phone. I prefer it over my iPhone for daily usage.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Even on 60hz the battery life is not so great.Cameras are pretty good for the price. There are some downsides.1.Wide angle on low light is not so great.2.I wish pro mode could be used on all 3 cameras.3. Portrait mode should have used 3x zoom.Lastly the in display fingerprint sensor is bad. I would have proffered  a physical fingerprint sensor instead.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Devaprasad,Awesome rear camera & UI,"1. Great UI. There are some unique features that are not found in others. I love Samsung Pass, Secure Folder & Bixby Routines. Almost bug free. Found few UI inconsistencies though but rarely.2. Rear Camera is awesome. Front is just average. Need to do some research on optimization. I have Pixel 4a. Rear cam in Samsung is much better.3. Battery is average. I use heavily for browsing. No gaming. Need to full charge daily once. With 15W charger takes almost 1.5 hr to reach 100 from 10.4. Fingerprint unlock isn't as slow as mentioned by others. Also further it can be increased a bit by removing it from optimization list. But I hardly use fingerprint as double tap with facial unlock works most of the time. Double tap to lock is also a great addon.5. Screen is great. In hand feel is great.6. Currently running on Android 12.7. Wireless charger works. But slow. There is no 3.5mm jack (may be to make it waterproof).8. No audio cue on call recording. Call quality is good.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I am glad to tell you that samsung One Ui rom is loaded with features which I am loving it. Like my AR model dances on screwn whenever I get a call or make a call, which is so cool!

Rishabh,Good features at a good price,"I moved onto this device after using poco F1 for 3 years. Here are the issues I faced:- It's very hard to unlock this device. Face unlock rarely works, fingerprint scanner is very slow, and doesn't work half of the time. I just ended up setting an easy pattern for quickly unlocking the device.Samsung should have just given hardware fingerprint scanner here. Unlocking this phone feels like a big task.- Device is long, and less wide. So keyboard keys get very thin and keys are close, so there are lots of accidental key presses for someone with big thumbs.- Battery backup is poor. My three year old poco still has more screen time than this new samsung s20fe. I had to disable 120hz display, and manually put some apps to sleep, to make my battery last whole day.Positives are as usual, good camera, device is fast thanks to latest processor....But because of poor battery and bad unlocking experience, I just hope that I didn't buy this device.",3.0 out of 5 stars

ABHISHEK PHADNIS,Review and Verdict,"I am a power user, and has been using this handset since over 3 months now. I would break down my review in Pros, Cons and VerdictPros: - Excellent display: If you like true to life colours or vivid colours, either can be set in display settings - Camera: In the world, where there are 108MP Camera phones at half the price, this 12 MP camera setup takes way better shots than them. All 3 cameras are useful. Plain, simple and no Gimmick. Attached some raw moon shot - Unmatched Customization: If you are a pro user and love customization, you can use Good Lock Modules and customize the hell out of this phone. - Regular Updates: I have consistently received the updates on this device. Samsung Promised to give 3 major updates, and 4 years of security update. - IP Ratings: This provides peace of mind even if your cell phone gets wet - Audio: Dolby Atmos does work. Sound quality is loud and clear from the handset speakers. Though not balanced, as earphone is doubled as the left speaker.Cons: - Battery: You will need to carry a charger / power bank if you game, take videos, capture ton of photos as a single charge won't last a day - Missing 3.5 mm Jack: Inspite of excellent audio quality, you will need to run for a good Type c to 3.5mm jack to get the best out. The cheap ones dont get recognized by the devices. The other ones that do, doesn't provide good quality audio. I had to buy original Samsung Type C to 3.5MM Jack to get best quality audio from the cell phoneVerdict: - This phone does serve as a complete package who really wants that ""true flagship"" like experience. - This handset does not surpass iPhone level photography, however does take pictures that stand in comparison. to it. When compared with Pixel, photography  is certainly better. Unlike those crappy 108MP cameras or Gimmick sensors.Go for it if you like balanced handset with flaglship like featrures like IP rating, Wireless Chargers without bragging too much about numbers.  If you are someone who like bragging numbers, this handset is certainly not for you mate. Go buy Poco, Narzo, etc",5.0 out of 5 stars
Malcolm Dias,The best electronic device I've ever purchased,"Bought this phone in December for rs. 34000/-. At that price i really can't believe the features I've got. The main camera is brilliant.. the selfie cam on permanent night mode is good, phone is buttery smooth, multitasking using good lock ie one hand operation + edge panel is brilliant, one UI 4 on Android 12 is great and Bixby routines are fantastic and i can't live without them now, battery life may be an issue for people who don't use Bixby routines.. with routines my phone lasts throughout the day and i get 7+ hours SOT. I already have a samsung watch, Buds live and tab S6 lite so as a bonus the s20 fe completes my ecosystem perfectly too(auto switch, call and text on other devices etc). Dex mode is brilliant and my tv is now a monitor for work too. Icing on the cake is how well it integrates with my windows 11 laptop(samsung flow and link to other devides). Honestly the best purchase I've ever made. Only downside is it's official release was September 2020.. so we ll only get support uptil Android 13 and all security updates will stop by September 2024. I fully expect my phone to last until September 2024 since it's water proof and can be wirelessly charged if the charging port malfunctions so I've worked it out as rs. 34000 for 34 months which is rs. 1000 a month which is fantastic for this phone. Only con is i don't get why samsung dint put a 25w charger in the box. That being said it's better for the battery.. and i slow charge my phone for 2.30 hours every night using a smart plug so it doesn't really affect me yet(but maybe it will annoy me in 2 years when the battery will degrade). This phone is and was samsung at its best. I doubt we ll see such good value again since their pricing for their good decides isn't usually so budget friendly. 5 out of 5 starts for sure.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sandhikshan Das,Overall awesome camera phone at 25k,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†This samsung galaxy s20 fe has all modern features  including quick responsive in display fingerprint reader, 5g ready bands, good 4500mah of battery life with 25w fast charging , reverse charging and lag free performance .  I mainly brought this phone for camera purpose and few other reasons . My reasons are below for which you could buy this phone -‚Ä¢ Awesome triple camera setup which is totally tuned by samsung's own isocell sensor. It has best night photography by 3lens .‚Ä¢ The ultra wide angle 12mp lens has Optical image stabilization (OIS) which is very hard to get at this budget . Ois will help you to achieve a smooth stabilized video footage .‚Ä¢ The camera setup has 8mp of telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom which is very useful for on the go photo /videography . You can shoot any far away object by zooming at very clear resolution unlike any other Smartphone at this budget .It may replace your dslr zoom lens also  .‚Ä¢Front camera is also great cause it has 32mp sensor which may be ideal for many travel vloggers and front camera shoots upto 4k including back .‚Ä¢ Back camera has bokeh video effect which can give a feel like a dslr video‚Ä¢ The whole smart phone is Ip68 fully waterproof . So can be used at anywhere in any weather condition . And it is really hard to find a waterproof phone at this price.‚Ä¢ Incase you need more space for photo or video beyond of 128gb you can expand the memory by any class 10 or extreme memory card .‚Ä¢ Also it has 120hz awesome amoled panel  by samsung itself.So these are the my 8 main cause, why you should go for this device . In reality  it is a really camera oriented Smartphone with all round performance. I'm using this device since last 5 months and amazed by its camera . Recently I made a trip to hill with one and only this s20 fe device as my main camera . This phone is not a hardcore gaming phone , It can improve battery draining issue a lil bit but that's ok for me as i wanted a real camera phone at 25000 . So if you want a extreme long battery phone , then forget this . It just giving good battery backup . I'm just happy with it . Getting 1 day battery backup on moderate use of camera and internet while 4 days standby time with moderate phone call .",5.0 out of 5 stars

(I do not play games for more than 1-2hr so length may vary.) No heating problem noticed by me.With hand on heart I dipped it under water and yes it is working still. It is designed in India phone and is 5G. Samsung is also the developer of LTE software which Jio towers use to provide network.Many phones may come with higher processors than s20fe 5g  but no one will give performance, ip68 rating and camera as good as samsung.Cons:Cameras are out on back, so I am afraid to keep phone on rough surfaces.Fingerprint is bit slow.No 25W charger.

Mandeep Sandhu,Best Phone Under 40K,"Hey FriendsI am writing this review after using Samsung S20 FE 5G for 7 days.Few things I would like to before starting this review, I have used mobiles from many other brands also before this Samsung S20 FE 5G. I have used Asus Zenfone 5Z, Redmi Note Series, Poco X3 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Now I have upgraded from my Samsung S10e to Samsung S20 FE 5G.From last 4-5 Months I wanted to upgrade my Samsung S10e to new phone. My budget for new phone was about 40K to 45K. My first choice was Asus Zenfone 8Z because of it's compact form factor and flagship specifications. But it was not launched in India. So now I was having 2 Choices for new phone, Samsung S20 FE 5G and One Plus 9 5G.After researching for about 10 Days I decided to buy Samsung S20 FE 5G over One Plus 9 5G. I got S20 FE 5G for 38K while I was Getting One plus 9 5G for 37K.Reasons to buy Samsung S20 FE 5G Over One Plus 9 5G1. Overall Better Cameras2. 9 5G Bands as compare to 1 or 2 5G Bands in One Plus 9 5G3. Wireless Charging + Reverse Wireless Charging4. One UI5. IP686. Micro SD CardBattery Backup and Speakers Sound quality is almost same on both phones. Snapdragon 865 is enough for me as this is my primary phone and I don't use it for gaming (I have Poco X3 Pro just for gaming).Now Here is my review for Samsung S20 FE 5G After using for 7 Days.1. Battery: Battery life on this phone is awesome. With normal use you can easily get 1.5 days to 2 days of battery life. With some heavy usage you can last a full day easily. I have attached 2 screenshots of battery life details here and you can see it yourself. You can easily get 6 to 7 Hours of onscreen time on this phone. With my Samsung s10e it very hardly last for full day with normal use. (Note: I always use display at 60Hz not 120hz because for normal usage it don't bother me and you can get better battery life)2. Cameras: Cameras on this phone are great. Coming from Samsung s10e to S20 FE 5G I can tell you that this phone has very capable cameras. (If you want a better camera than please buy this over One plus 9 5G). it's cameras are absolutely upgrade from Samsung S10e. I have attached some camera samples also with this review. You can see the quality of camera of this phone. (I don't use selfie camera so I will not comment about it)3. Performance: As I have told earlier that this is my primary phone and I don't use it for gaming. For daily usage it is very fast and snappy. No lags, no hangs, no overheating. You will not notice any slow downs on this phone. Snapdragon 865 is still very capable chip in 2022. I have also attached Benchmarks screenshots if you want to see it's performance.4. Screen: Screen on this phone is awesome friends. For media and entertainment this is awesome phone. Visibility in direct sunlight is also very good. You will have no difficulty using this device outdoor in sunny days.Finger Print scanner is 8/10. It is accurate and fast.Overall it is one of the best device under 40K, awesome battery life, awesome cameras, awesome display and awesome performance.But I will also like to add some negatives also you should keep in mind about this device:1. Display is not adaptive 120Hz Display. It will not automatically change refresh rate of screen according to your use which effects battery life.2. No 3.5 mm audio jackNote: I will update this review after using this device for more days.",5.0 out of 5 stars
pranav nehra,STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE,"My phone is above 40 degrees all the time, battery charges in 2 hours 30 mins and give me a screen on tone of 4 hours. It also goes from 15% to 0 in 5 mins. I went to samsung service centre and all they did was reset my phone and called in 2 hours after and gave it to me. I tested it in front of them, battery went down 4% in 4 minutes. Temperature was 40 degrees with just keeping the screen on. That samsung dude was trying to treat me like a toddler. Sir aisa hi hota hai.

Average camera, average battery, annoyingly slow fingerprint and face reader and processing speed is.just fine for your everyday tasks. I have used samsung m31 and this phone is just like m31 in all redpects except yhat the battery of.m31 was 6000 mah so better. Even when j bought the phone from the store, I felt a huge difference between s20 and s21. But I fooled myself into buying this phone as s21 was double the cost.

You won't be disappointed.The only thing which bothered me is my finger sometimes coming into contact with the edges of the glass display(which feels sharp) when I pull the notification tray down, you can fix even that by putting on a screen guard.

Kevin Rufus,Beautiful Phone - Gets you close to the flagship experience,"To begin with, I had to return the initial product delivered to me. It had minor bumps on the left side of the screen in the (edgy) place where the screen is fitted to the body but had no other problems with it functionally. I made a complaint call to amazon and got my replacement the same day itself. I have been using the replacement for a week now.Overall cost was around 31k INR via coupons & Amazon Summer Sale'22.First and foremost, I had made a conscious decision to replace this phone by the end of they year even before I clicked the purchase button because I somehow felt that I was very late to buy it (was released in 2020; and the 2022 variant is not available in India so far). But the handset is impressive and those of you looking for a future proof phone, this product will definitely be viable for another couple of years at the least if not more.Its a bit lengthy and definitely is chunkier than most phones I have handled (which is actually not that many; definitely no flagships or ultras) but the weight is nicely distributed and is very comfortable to hold. However, the finish both front and back despite looking so elegant are prone to be muddled by finger prints (I constantly wipe the screen and back with a micro fiber cloth just to admire it in its pristine form ;p).Display is extra-ordinary (120 Hz by default). Perhaps it is the USP of this product and Samsung screens are anyway the golden standard in this part of the globe at least. Smooth screen transitions, buttery responsive to touch (can be adjusted). Overall display and screen are flagship-grade. I am very careful with most of my electronics so the gorilla glass 3 (I have seen some reviews where people have dropped this phone and completely lost their screen - usually through shattering) does not really bother me and there is no direct impact on resolution or touch as far as I am concerned.The snapdragon 865 compliments the screen and display with good handling of most common applications, the phone OS and the manufacturer specific features. I have never had any stutter or slowness so far but then it has only been a week and I will update this section after a few months of usage. There was noticeable heating while setting up the phone and never after thatI am in no means a power user (but the SD865 is making me feel like one :p). I consume high amounts of streaming media, moderate time with messenger & email apps and the occasional games and I can say that my phone sees moderate to less screen-on time on a regular day. The battery is fit enough and more to handle these requirements and the 8GB RAM is sufficient. I plan to do some stress tests on the battery and RAM; will add the outcomes in the next update to this review. The charging is also fast (via the in box 15W adapter) and I have not plugged in my phone more than once in 48 hrs (for a full charge-discharge cycle: 100% to 10%).The cameras for which I had no expectations because I am not a big user of them seem to be a very big step up from my Nokia 6.1. Good colors when there is sufficient lighting around, good quality of zoomed in/out pics; adequate for a user like me and from the reviews I have heard of the phone they can be punchy enough to produce some magical shots in the hands of a knowledgeable user.Audio is excellent; could not expect more. Strong but filtered output from the receiver even if I keep the phone around my ears instead of pressing them against the ears. The bottom speaker is also sturdy and it pairs well with the receiver to produce a fluent stereo experience. I have already moved on from the 3.5mm jack; I am using the Samsung buds pro and loving it.So as you may have observed, I have just graduated to a no-compromise midship segment of smartphones and my next handset will definitely be a pure flagship. The S20 FE has in its first week, made a great impression and I do not see myself going back to budget or mid range phones from here (that in my opinion is a good impact for a fan edition handset).People, this is a very underrated phone (S21 FE seems like an unimpressive hollywood sequel to the S20 FE as per my understanding). Go for this phone - it is a blessing at the 30-40k range for users like me who are looking to move up towards the flagship experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Shoeb,Great phone if priced around INR 35k.,"Great phone even in 2022 if priced at around INR 35k. However the unit you get would be of 2021 make given the company has already introduced the S21FE model.The device has got the Android 12 and Samsung's One UI 4.0 update as well.Rear Camera quality is great if there is good lighting. The telephoto lens is not used under low light, instead it uses digital zoom of the primary lens.The front camera isn't much to talk about. It lacks autofocus and isn't the best to be used in low light situations. If you like taking selfies, try some other models.Fingerprint reader is not the best. While works most of the time, there have been moments where it failed to work. Adding a screen guard might make this worse.Battery works till the end of the day for normal usage without gaming or long duration of video watching.Screen quality is good and uses 120hz display or 60hz depending upon the setting. An adaptive display would have helped in extending the battery life.Call quality is good. Didn't face any problems till yet in this department.Sound quality is decent. However a lack of physical 3.5mm headphone jack means you only have to rely on wireless earphones.There is also an option of expanding the storage using a memory card but then you loose out the dual sim capability.Package includes an adaptive charger, a C-type cable and sim ejector tool along with documentation.Overall the phone is a good buy if you get it at around INR 35k and if you like the Samsung eco system, else there are many newer models from other brands at a similar price point with the latest hardware.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Gulam Hussain,Best Midrange mobile at 30k,"Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Sunil P.,Poor sound,Poor sound as compared to other phones. Have to wear the earphones to listen to songs or videos. Also very slow in charging.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Ashish Rai,An excellent phone for the price,"An excellent phone for the price. Flagship specs, though at a much more affordable price. The SD soc is the clincher. Good screen, decent cameras, and good, clean looks. If you are not a glass and metal person, this is definitely the go to for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
KUMAR ROHIT,Simply Awesome.... Just Loved it,"This is a really good phone.I bought it at 27k in summer sale after all coupon discount, card offers and exchangeIt's 10x times better than China's OnePlus. Simply loved it.Great performance and speedPros :1. 120 Hz Amoled Display2. 865 SD processor3. Major plus point - Camera ( it has 12 MP, no Gimmicks or tricks like China's 50 Mp or 108 mp)4. Light weightCons :1. No fast charging ( but, it can easily lasts a day )2. Not so quick Fingerprint sensor ( i think, it may be im using a tempered glass. Don't know)As I said, i bought it for 27k. In this price range and few bucks beyond also, No other phone can come this close.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Nagabhushan,My review after 3 months of use.,"Right off the bat, a brilliant phone!! I picked it up for 30,990/- and I must say, it's worth every rupee, atleast to me.The build quality is solid. Don't let the idea that it's a plastic back strike as a negative point.I get a full day's worth battery out of a full charge in the morning. Plus, the charger from the box is really good too. Might not be a 25W charger, but I get good charge time out of it.The display is the tried and true, Samsung display with brilliant colours.The other specs, such as the processor is brilliant too. I don't play games, so I could not judge it's capabilities. For my use, it's butter smooth and no heating issues have come up.The camera is solid too.I would 100% recommend this phone to whomever who planning on buying a phone in this range.Wait for sales though, you'll get this for much less.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Placeholder,Flagship performance at a Upper mid range price,This is truly a flagship phone. With SD 865 and almost 8-9 5g bands its future proof. Battery life is awesome can last 1 day to 1.5 day as per usage with almost 6.5 hrs Screen on time. Camera is awesome all the lenses are fully functional and no marketing gimmick of 64MP camera and quad camera is there. And all these features with KNOX security is awesome... Bought it at 40K during sale.... and its an awesome price for this phone.,5.0 out of 5 stars
